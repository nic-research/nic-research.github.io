- <2012-11-14 Wed> 
Test beamline-to-trap valve to assess leak-rate.
- <2012-11-16 Fri> 
No significant leak rate when closed down
  tightly. If closed down with ordinary firmness, there's a pretty
  significant leak-rate of up to 1E-7 mbarl/s. It takes some
  significant amount more force to properly close it.
- <2012-11-20 Tue> 
Matthias is a bit worried about this
  behaviour. I should probably test again to see if it behaves the
  same every time or if the performance degrades.
- <2012-12-04 Tue>
Just as before, the valve must be closed fairly tight in order that
there be no leaks. Of course this gets worse every time we open and
close it. We should get a torque wrench for this type of thing.

*** DONE Pressure vs pulse voltage
- <2012-11-08 Thu>
  Ion pump and second ion gauge installed. Retaking
  data to include both gauge readings and a proper Voltmeter reading
  of the variac output voltage. 
  
  Notes of 6.11.12 have some data taken with o-scope voltage reading
  of variac voltage and only one gauge, if we need it, but I'm not
  transcribing because I'm about to take better data (I hope).
  
  Accidentally took a whole set of data with the separation valve
  open. Will leave the system to pump down overnight and start again
  with the valve closed tomorrow. N.B. Clockwise opens (bolt /out/),
  anti-clockwise closes (bolt /in/). (-EDIT <2013-01-09 Wed> This is
  /wrong/. It is the other way around -> bolt in - open, bolt out -
  closed).

  In any case the ion pump is fairly weak. The readings on the two
  separated chambers (valve closed) after time to pump out were:
  : g1 = 1.86E-8 mbar
  : g2 = 4.8E-8 mbar
  : Ip = 35 uA
  Where g1 is the pressure behind the nozzle (pumped by turbo), g2 is
  the pressure after the nozzle (pumped by ion pump), and Ip is the
  current on the ion pump. Will check these values again in the
  morning, since these may not be fully settled values (the separator
  valve was closed the entire time, meaning the beam-line chamber was
  being pumped only through the nozzle hole)

- <2012-11-09 Fri> 
Beamline chamber pumped out overnight with
  separator valve open and ion pump off: g1 = 6.95E-9 mbar, g2 =
  3.0E-8 mbar
  
  Ion pump on, readings settling (?) at: g1 = 6.5E-9, g2 = 2.2E-8, Ip
  = 11 uA
  
  After closing separator valve, pressure settles at: g1 = 5.5E-9, g2
  = 2.0E-8, Ip = 10 uA
  
  NB g1 is the gauge in the valve chamber, before the nozzle, g2 is
  the gauge at the target, Ip is the ion pump pressure.
  
  Took a set of pressure vs pulse valve voltage readings, but forgot
  to put N2 pressure behind the valve. I'll take another set of
  readings on Monday with N2 pressure, but since it probably won't
  make a difference, here's the data taken today:

  Shows a ratio, at best, of x50 between the pressures of the
  chambers, and that at reasonably high second chamber pressure
  (1E-6). The data needs to be taken again, of course, with N2
  pressure behind the pulse valve.

  Today's data (above) shows pretty much the same behaviour. apart
  from starting at a lower pressure thanks to having been pumped out
  for longer, the pressure readings as a function of pulse voltage are
  almost exactly the same and so, therefore, is the ratio.
  
  I'm not entirely convinced that this tells us a great deal about
  what the beamline will do once attached to the trap however. Since
  the molecular beam currently has nowhere to go (firing directly at
  the second gauge), the load on the ion pump is likely to be much
  larger than we can expect when the beam is directed at the trap
  chamber.

  Some thoughts: 
  * The ion pump is there mostly to pump out lighter
    elements that leak into the second chamber. Having it pump out the
    molecules is not its job, so how is this measurement relevant?
  * If it is a relevant measurement then the pressure ratio is
    probably not high enough. The two solutions suggested by Matthias
    are a) adding a turbo to the second chamber b) if the N2
    photoionisation is efficient enough, only using a single pulse to
    load.
  
  In today's meeting, Laura points out that the data above must be at
  least partly a cumulative distribution function, since there's
  probably not enough time to pump out gases from the previous
  readings. If data were taken at regular intervals then maybe we
  could take the difference in order to compensate for that. On the
  other hand I don't know whether this is valid if the pumping
  efficiency depends on the chamber pressure.
  
  On my comment that the ion pump will not be pumping so many
  molecules in the ultimate setup, Matthias points out that there will
  be a second skimmer in that chamber, and so it's really not too far
  off.

  Matthias would also like me to check the bandwidth of the analog
  output of the ion gauge, even if it's slow, we can use it to measure
  the pressure change from single pulses. If these are small enough
  and spaced out in time, then we won't have the problem of cumulative
  pressure, as the pumps will have time to clear out the remnants of
  previous pulses.
  
  The latter would be about all we could do without more info on the
  N2 photoionisation efficiency.

*** DONE Pressure build-up
- <2012-11-14 Wed> 
Characterise `build-up' of gas by varying pulse
  voltage at low rep. rate. Watch the display or analog output signal
  for settling time.
- <2012-11-16 Fri> 
If the pressures read on the continuous pulsing
  measurements is due to a build-up effect, then we might be okay to
  run at higher pulse voltages as long as the N2 photoionisation is
  efficient enough and we can use a small number of pulses. 
  
  I will test pressures for continuous pulsing, but with as low a
  repetition rate as I can bear to wait for (likely 0.1Hz).
- <2012-12-04 Tue>
Beam line pressure has had a chance to get nice and low:
: g1 = 1.9E-9 mbar
: g2 = 4.3E-9 mbar
: I_pump = 1 uA

Tested yesterday with a low repetitions rate of R = 0.1 Hz to
characterise the pressure differential and pump-out time.

The data is in my notebook entry for yesterday, but the brief summary
is that with a rep. rate of 0.1 Hz (i.e. 10 s pumping time), pressures
starts to build up in the chamber at a pulse height of around 180
V. At this point the pressure peak in the beam chamber is around
(7+/-2)E-9 mbar. Compared to the non-pulsed pressure of 4.3E-9 mbar,
this indicates very low pumping power/speed in the second chamber.

If the N2 photoionisation process is efficient enough, then it's
possible that we can do with just a single pulse. According to the
above data, if we fail to load an N2 ion then we must wait longer
(possibly much longer for sufficient neutral N2 density) than 10
seconds in order to apply another pulse. 

For these reasons I think it would be a good idea to consider adding a
TMP to the beamline chamber.

*** TODO TMP installation
- <2012-12-04 Tue>
Data in previous headline indicates there's not enough pumping power
and the ion trap region in the beamline chamber. It's time to consider
adding a turbo to pump alongside the ion pump to maintain a good
pressure differential between the beamline and the trapping region. 

** DONE LICT spectroscopy preliminary
- <2012-12-03 Mon>. Reading:
Matthias has sent me some papers on LICT with Argon and N2. We're
looking to perform some variations on the experiments done in these
papers and he wants me to make some calculations based on the
information in the papers. More info to follow.

- <2012-12-06 Thu>. Collision rates:
Matthias wants to know whether we can do spectroscopy on the
rotational state of N2 using LICT (laser-induced charge transfer) with
Argon. The main question is whether or not we can get a high enough
collision rate, using the leak valve, in order to do the spectroscopy
in a reasonable time. If the pressure of Ar is too high, then our
crystal might not be stable enough. If the pressure of Ar is to low,
then the experiment will take beyond a resonable amount of time for
proper statistics.

The reaction rate as a function of Ar pressure can be calculated
fairly simply from the cross-section and the population of the chosen
N2+ (nu>0) state, as I believe it is a reaction with no dependence on
temperature. The cross-section and further details should be found in
the Wilitsch papers.

- PRA 83, 023415 (2011):
According to PRA 83, 023415 (2011) "Subsequent fluorescent decay of
the electronically excited state populates vibrationally excited
levels in the ground electronic state with a probability of 55%." This
gives us a rough value of population to make preliminary calculations
from.


This paper uses an Ar pressure of 5E-8 mbar for reactions, but looks
at a much larger crystal than we plan to i.e. one calcium ion and one
N2+/Ar+. When off-resonant with the excitation laser they look for
thirty seconds to see if there's been any reactions. This can be taken
for a rough value to check results against.

Measured second order rate coefficient for N2+&N2 charge exchange: 
: k = (3.8+-2.0)x10^-10 cm^3s^-1
: (r = k[N2+(nu > 0)][Ar])

"The bimolecular rate constant was calculated from the measured
pseudo-first-order rate coefficient k = tau - 1 using a nitrogen
partial pressure of p = (1.1+-0.6)e-10 mbar in our UHV chamber, as
measured with a residual-gas analyzer."

-----

- Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 185/186/187, 589 (1999):
Charge transfer rate coefficient:
: N2+(nu > 0) + Ar -> Ar+ + N2
: k_CT = (4+-2)e-10 cm^3s^-1

This charge transfer rate coefficient is all I need to make the
necessary calculations, using the differential rate equation
: R = k_CT[Ar],

given [Ar], the density of Argon in cm^-3.

- Crystal `cleaning':
Another point of interest is whether or not, after confirming charge
exchange between N2 and Argon, we can expel the Argon from the crystal
without losing the calcium. Apart from the reaction rate, calcium
loading would be the main time-limiting factor of the experiment.

Expulsion of N2 after a non-reaction would be fairly straightforward
given that it has a very different mass from Ca. In this case, we can
change the q-value of the trap in order to make it unstable for the
mass range of N2. The problem with argon (atomic number 18) is that
the mass is similar to Ca (#20), and so the q change would risk losing
Ca as well. 

Kevin has suggested loading Ca-44 instead of Ca-40, which would give
us better separation. Lasers can fairly easily be tuned to the right
wavelengths to deal with this, and Kevin says loading can be done by
tuning the photoionisation laser to Ca-44 whilst simulataneously
applying a modulation at the Ca-40 secular frequency in order to
prevent trapping the inevitable 40-isotopes (there is significant
overlap in the wavelengths given the relative abundance of Ca-40 to
44).

If the above technique works though, then it might be worthwhile
checking whether or not a combination of moderate q-changing and
excitation at the Ca-40 secular frequency couldn't do the job for us,
and save us the trouble of retuning our wavelengths and dealing with
relatively low abundances of Ca-44.

- <2012-12-07 Fri> Collision rates:
Since we need to prepare N2 in specific states for
spectroscopy (the normal thermal distribution has fairly low
population in the lower rotational levels), N2-N2 charge exchange
limits the time we have to get an Ar reaction by replacing our
state-prepared and subsequently vibrationally excited N2 ion with an
ion in the vibrational ground state.

The calculations for this experiment ended up being fairly
straightforward: The rate constant given for the N2 to Ar charge
transfer reaction is the same as the rate constant given for N2 to N2
charge transfer. Without the beamline, we are planning to leak N2
simultaneously with Ar via the leak-valve. This means that the
relative pressure of N2 must be high enough for photoionisation and
capture in the trap, but not so high that N2-N2 charge transfer is the
dominant reaction. We can't know whether this will be possible until
we know more about the photoionisation efficiency. This is information
we plan to get either from the N2 spectroscopy setup or from the trap
directly in the next few weeks.

Another problem in this arrangement is that, according to the Wilitsch
group, Ar is fairly easy to ionise, being closer to a two-photon
process than the three-photon process of N2. This means that with
relatively large abundance of Ar, we could have a problem selectively
preparing the Ca-N2 coulomb crystal. If we had a good crystal cleaning
method maybe that wouldn't be a problem, since then we could keep
trying to load N2, whilst ejecting Ar as necessary.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. 

By stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave
lasers relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length
of the cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s, a significant
improvement on previous scanning-cavity stabilization systems."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.
