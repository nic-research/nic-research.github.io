Core functionality written and working on the industrial PC (can we
call it Marvin?). Command latency is very high, could cause problems
unless we use the machine's sequential data set mode. On the other
hand we could try to get to the bottom of the latency issue.

Matthias has a power supply we can use. It doesn't need to be high
  current since the current is supplied from a charged capacitor.

- <2012-10-31 Wed> 
No input for the power supply, have they sent us a
 different model than they meant to?

 Current testing is on an inductor coil chosen to roughly match that
  of the valve. A previous entry states that I measured the inductance
  to be roughly 5.8 mH recently. Lab notes from February suggest an
  inductance of 18 mH. Either way the closest inductor we have is 100
  mH, with 75 Ohm resistance. Given that the valve is 1 Ohm, are these
  similar enough to test, or different enough to have damaged the
  circuit?

- <2012-11-05 Mon> 
E-mail from Chris:
 " Hello,
   That should be OK to drive a valve. Are you supplying a trigger pulse?
   Have you tried adjusting the spring tension while it's running? Turn
   the valve face while holding the body and in one position it should
   get nice and loud. "
- Replaced a fuse on the main circuit-board and now it works fine.
- Characterisation up next: 
  * Opening/closing time (pulse monitor output)
  * Beamline pressure gradient

- <2012-11-06 Tue>
Characterisation, f = 10Hz, tau = 100 us:
  | Var /% | P /mbar |
  |--------+---------|
  |      0 |  3.3E-8 |
  |      5 |  3.3E-8 |
  |     10 |  3.3E-8 |
  |     15 |  3.3E-8 |
  |     20 |  3.3E-8 |
  |     25 |  3.3E-8 |
  |     30 |  3.3E-8 |
  |     35 |  3.3E-8 |
  |     40 |  4.5E-8 |
  |   42.5 |  4.1E-7 |
  |     45 |  4.5E-7 |
  |--------+---------|

- For f = 10 Hz, tau = 1 ms, Var = 0 %, the valve pulsing is clearly
  audible and the pressure rises imediately to ~1E-3. The load on the
  turbo pump remains the same (low) however, so I suppose I need an
  upper limit on the pressure in the beam line.
- NB cable for the old ion pump has gone missing, so for now the above
  tests are made without it.
- NB2 there is a second ion gauge that can be plugged in once the ion
  pump is up and running, but the skimmer chamber should be isolated
  from the ion pump chamber once it is.

** TODO Beam-line characterisation
*** DONE Pressure vs pulse voltage
- <2012-11-08 Thu>
  Ion pump and second ion gauge installed. Retaking
  data to include both gauge readings and a proper Voltmeter reading
  of the variac output voltage. 
  
  Notes of 6.11.12 have some data taken with o-scope voltage reading
  of variac voltage and only one gauge, if we need it, but I'm not
  transcribing because I'm about to take better data (I hope).
  
  Accidentally took a whole set of data with the separation valve
  open. Will leave the system to pump down overnight and start again
  with the valve closed tomorrow. N.B. Clockwise opens (bolt /out/),
  anti-clockwise closes (bolt /in/).

  In any case the ion pump is fairly weak. The readings on the two
  separated chambers (valve closed) after time to pump out were:
  : g1 = 1.86E-8 mbar
  : g2 = 4.8E-8 mbar
  : Ip = 35 uA
  Where g1 is the pressure behind the nozzle (pumped by turbo), g2 is
  the pressure after the nozzle (pumped by ion pump), and Ip is the
  current on the ion pump. Will check these values again in the
  morning, since these may not be fully settled values (the separator
  valve was closed the entire time, meaning the beam-line chamber was
  being pumped only through the nozzle hole)

- <2012-11-09 Fri> 
Beamline chamber pumped out overnight with
  separator valve open and ion pump off: g1 = 6.95E-9 mbar, g2 =
  3.0E-8 mbar
  
  Ion pump on, readings settling (?) at: g1 = 6.5E-9, g2 = 2.2E-8, Ip
  = 11 uA
  
  After closing separator valve, pressure settles at: g1 = 5.5E-9, g2
  = 2.0E-8, Ip = 10 uA
  
  NB g1 is the gauge in the valve chamber, before the nozzle, g2 is
  the gauge at the target, Ip is the ion pump pressure.
  
  Took a set of pressure vs pulse valve voltage readings, but forgot
  to put N2 pressure behind the valve. I'll take another set of
  readings on Monday with N2 pressure, but since it probably won't
  make a difference, here's the data taken today:

Want to take a new set of readings, with N2
  pressure behind valve. Settled values: g1 = 2.5E-9 mbar, g2 =6.5E-9
  mbar, Ip = 2 uA.
  
  Amy is working around the gauge and has to unplug it. She says
  she'll be done tonight so I'll make the measurements in the
  morning.

[[file:beam_line_data_12_11_12.png][beam line data 2012-11-09]] -> Friday's data
  Shows a ratio, at best, of x50 between the pressures of the
  chambers, and that at reasonably high second chamber pressure
  (1E-6). The data needs to be taken again, of course, with N2
  pressure behind the pulse valve.

  Today's data (above) shows pretty much the same behaviour. apart
  from starting at a lower pressure thanks to having been pumped out
  for longer, the pressure readings as a function of pulse voltage are
  almost exactly the same and so, therefore, is the ratio.
  
  I'm not entirely convinced that this tells us a great deal about
  what the beamline will do once attached to the trap however. Since
  the molecular beam currently has nowhere to go (firing directly at
  the second gauge), the load on the ion pump is likely to be much
  larger than we can expect when the beam is directed at the trap
  chamber.

  Some thoughts: 
  * The ion pump is there mostly to pump out lighter
    elements that leak into the second chamber. Having it pump out the
    molecules is not its job, so how is this measurement relevant?
  * If it is a relevant measurement then the pressure ratio is
    probably not high enough. The two solutions suggested by Matthias
    are a) adding a turbo to the second chamber b) if the N2
    photoionisation is efficient enough, only using a single pulse to
    load.
  
  In today's meeting, Laura points out that the data above must be at
  least partly a cumulative distribution function, since there's
  probably not enough time to pump out gases from the previous
  readings. If data were taken at regular intervals then maybe we
  could take the difference in order to compensate for that. On the
  other hand I don't know whether this is valid if the pumping
  efficiency depends on the chamber pressure.
  
  On my comment that the ion pump will not be pumping so many
  molecules in the ultimate setup, Matthias points out that there will
  be a second skimmer in that chamber, and so it's really not too far
  off.

  Matthias would also like me to check the bandwidth of the analog
  output of the ion gauge, even if it's slow, we can use it to measure
  the pressure change from single pulses. If these are small enough
  and spaced out in time, then we won't have the problem of cumulative
  pressure, as the pumps will have time to clear out the remnants of
  previous pulses.
  
  The latter would be about all we could do without more info on the
  N2 photoionisation efficiency.

*** TODO Pressure build-up
- <2012-11-14 Wed> 
Characterise `build-up' of gas by varying pulse
  voltage at low rep. rate. Watch the display or analog output signal
  for settling time.
- <2012-11-16 Fri> 
If the pressures read on the continuous pulsing
  measurements is due to a build-up effect, then we might be okay to
  run at higher pulse voltages as long as the N2 photoionisation is
  efficient enough and we can use a small number of pulses. 
  
  I will test pressures for continuous pulsing, but with as low a
  repetition rate as I can bear to wait for (likely 0.1Hz).

** TODO Beam-line preparation
*** DONE Test beamline-to-trap valve
- <2012-11-14 Wed> 
Test beamline-to-trap valve to assess leak-rate.
- <2012-11-16 Fri> 
No significant leak rate when closed down
  tightly. If closed down with ordinary firmness, there's a pretty
  significant leak-rate of up to 1E-7 mbarl/s. It takes some
  significant amount more force to properly close it.
- <2012-11-20 Tue> 
Matthias is a bit worried about this
  behaviour. I should probably test again to see if it behaves the
  same every time or if the performance degrades.
- <2012-12-04 Tue>
Just as before, the valve must be closed fairly tight in order that
there be no leaks. Of course this gets worse every time we open and
close it. We should get a torque wrench for this type of thing.

- <2012-11-26 Mon>
Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. 

By stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave
lasers relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length
of the cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s, a significant
improvement on previous scanning-cavity stabilization systems."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

Each box of the double-coated mirrors contains four

** DONE Fix ReadP7888SingleChannel.vi
- <2012-11-29 Thu>
The vi that has been being used to analyse data from the p7888 up
until now has started acting up as of today. It's no longer reading
data correctly from the saved list files. It seems that it finds that
there is no data in the second channel and therefore the analysis dll
that Wolfgang wrote exits with an unspecified error.

If I use it to open up very old data sets it seems to work fine,
finding data in both channels and giving out the auto-correlation. If
I use it to open up yesterday's data however (from Amy's tests), it
doesn't work, and can't find data in the second channel. This is odd,
since from what Amy says the vi was working fine on that data
yesterday. 

The data from the channel that /is/ found doesn't seem to add up to
what it should do given the repetition rates and counts from the PMT. 

Looking at the data as it is taken  on the MCDWIN, it seems that there
is no signal on one of the channels in most cases. I don't really know
whether or not to expect anything, since I don't remember seeing it on
the other machine - it's worth a check on that machine I guess. On one
occassion I took a data set that looked on the MCDWIN as if there was
a single trigger on the second channel. The vi read both channels and
output an FFT, but the data looked sparse and mostly nonsensical.

I'm fairly certain it's not possible that the work I was doing on the
machine yesterday ( [[id:3c323710-c29c-414d-80e0-436929f53c13][Data analysis (FFT)]] ), could affect the analyser
vi. The vi doesn't pull from any of the p7888.dll functions or
settings in the first place, besides which I have been careful that my
program does not change any settings itself (for the moment it relies
on the user adjusting the settings manually in the server
program). The final nail in the coffin of that `possible-cause' is
that the vi no longer works on data it took yesterday, before I used
my software, and also doesn't seem to work on some of the other old
data that's been taken.

-<2012-11-30 Fri>
Kevin helpfully pointed out that the problem was that in the "data"
settings, the save file for the second module/channel needs to be the
same as for the first. Everything's working properly now. (That it
worked once without this set properly is just weird).
