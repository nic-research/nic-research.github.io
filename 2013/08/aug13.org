** Autocorrelation DLLs						       :logs:
I finished adapting Wolfgang and Hiroki's version of the
autocorrelation dlls for our purposes. 

Wolfgang's original was an all-in-one function that took a binary or
ascii list file from the hard-disk, and processed it to give a
cross-correlation and the FFT of that. In order to get an
autocorrelation one would have to pass the same signal to both inputs
of the cross-correlation.

Hiroki's DLL split apart that code into separate functions that read
the file, extracted the header and data for processing, and evaluated
the cross-correlation by a couple of different means. Also included is
a wrapper function that calls these in sequence to achieve the same
result as Wolfgang's (except without the FFT, since it was not needed
for Hiroki's purposes).

My DLL was required to take data straight from memory and process an
autocorrelation and FFT to extract the frequency and amplitude of
oscillation of a signal. This doesn't require processing the header or
the data from file (since I already have header information from
settings in the calling VI), and therefore I stripped those from my
DLL. Furthermore, I made my code less general (a good idea?), by
making it an explicit auto-correlation function with only one signal
input. In principle this should save us time copying the data arrays
over for the second input. 

One issue with this is that Wolfgang's original correlation code
relies on the data being in list-file format (i.e. a list of
timestamps), whereas live data from the p7888 comes in as a histogram
of arrival times. FastComTec have a dll that we could use to access
list data directly from the card, but they won't give it to us unless
we buy an unrelated SDK. However I have written a dll in c++ that
takes in a spectrum and spits out a list file for that purpose, and
rolled that into the vi that processes the autocorrelation and
FFT. There is an issue here with very long measurement times (up to
1~s expected by Kevin) and memory-size and efficiency of processing
the spectrum to a list file, but as long as we keep the binwidth
relatively high, we should still be okay.

The DLLs are included in [[file:automation_dlls][this]] link.

** The plan							       :logs:
Having completed the autocorrelation component of the automation, and
the general body of the infrastructure. All that remains is to
incorporate application-specific VIs such as Ca+ loading, N2+ loading,
state-detection and crystal cleaning. From what I understand Amy and
Kevin have already written VIs for Ca+ and N2+ loading, which can be
dropped into the automation software. They are also now working on
crystal cleaning, and it's not too far off. 

Since I'm leaving soon, I need to be handing over my knowledge of the
automation VI to Amy. As such, I will be testing it to make sure the
core functionality is there from next week, on Kevin's trap. Once the
bugs are ironed out, I'll be working with Amy so that she knows the
ins and outs and can make her own adjustments when necessary. 

I will also be speaking with Will and Amy about the programming for
the dlls so that they can build their own and make adjustments. 

Lastly, Matthias wants me to make a general overview of the core
skills required in the lab so that he can be sure we plan out
handovers like this in the future.

* To do: Molecule lab 
** TODO Interferometer							:Nic:
*** TODO Re-optimise around trap
*** TODO Check chromatic abberation
** TODO Photoionisation of N2					    :Nic:Amy:
*** TODO Explain photoionisation process
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Draw up diagram with our options, write-up including selection rules
(see Matthias).
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Some notes are in my logbook - need to write those up.
*** DONE Replace damaged optical elements in laser
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Waiting on parts
- <2013-08-06 Tue>
Parts arrived last week. They will be replaced next time the dye is
changed. This is more or less handed over to Amy however.
*** TODO Re-take spectra with better S-N
** CNCL Work on DACs for the new SCL				  :Nic:Kevin:
- <2013-08-28 Wed>
Not going to get time to do these before I leave, I think.
*** CNCL Building boards
- <2013-01-25 Fri> Matthias has the plans:
Pester him for them.
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Received:
Matthias sent them ages ago, but I didn't spot them in my mail. He's
still yet to order the actual DACs though, so there's still time. I
could make the boards however, in preparation.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Matthias is making the boards:
Matthias is making the boards, I think it'll just be up to me to
program the whole thing.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Pins used:
Check with Matthias that his design has incorporated these pins as
I/Os:
+ Port D: RD8 (peak detect input), RD5 (CN_interrupt)
+ U2RX pins, unless he's already designed these away
*** CNCL Programming
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with computer
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with DAC

** TODO [#B] Code an automation program for experiments		  :Nic:Kevin:
*** TODO [#A] Fast autocorrelation calculation
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
[X] Try using CUDA for a fast autocorrelation calculation 
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
Maybe first just try using Wolfgang's code. It might just be fast
enough on its own.
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Hiroki has refactored Wolfgang's code into sub-functions and I'm now
using his DLL. I tried running a few tests with python but it's really
way too slow for large datasets.
- <2013-08-28 Wed>
I've managed to make this work for a test data set in ascii using my
own dll extracted from Wolfgang and Hiroki's code. It should speed up
once I make it use binary data.
*** CNCL Describe phonon laser trick in notes
- <2013-05-15 Wed>
Check if I already have.
- <2013-06-10 Mon>
Only really required if it turns out to be usable. Waiting on Kevin's
results. 
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Not needed until the paper is written.
** TODO [#C] Simulations						:Nic:
*** TODO [#B] Single ion `heat-engine' effect
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Does the oscillation have something to do with a kind of `parametric'
excitation from the laser pressure - Perhaps the ion only feels force
from the laser when it is at the edges of its oscillation (no Doppler
shift).
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Still working on this, but got the dipole force nearly in
properly. Need to compare ways of calculating dipole force to make
sure they agree. If we don't see the effect with a 1D model, then
maybe we need to think about a 3D model (which Matthias reckons is the
only model that should fit). 
- <2013-08-30 Fri>
Matthias and I have agreed that I should refactor this general
simulation code so that it is clean and legible, then hand it over to
one of the students before I go. We've decided this should be Will. I
will find the time to do this, probably after handing over the
automation software to Amy.

*** HOLD [#B] Hanle dip/b-field map simulation
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Waiting on Kevin to make some measurements to see if they match my
simulations. 
**** HOLD [#C] Fluorescence as a function of B-field for different light pol.
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Done for now, need to talk about Matthias about results seen.
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Need to find a way of combining maps from different polarisations and
directions to give independent B-field direction data.
*** HOLD [#C] One or two calcium ions
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?
- <2013-05-28 Tue>
This question is not important if the `phonon-laser'-like approach
we're going to try and take works well. This idea is on hold until
more work is done there.
