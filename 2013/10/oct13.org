* Wednesday 9th (First entry of October)
** Heat engine: mistake spotted					       :logs:
The last few entries of September made mention that in order to see an
oscillation effect I had to multiply the dipole force by x1000. This
obviously indicated a mistake somewhere in the simulation, but I
couldn't spot where.

It turns out the mistake was not in the physics, but in the `layout'
of the simulation. I misunderstood the fundamental mechanism of the
effect until Matthias explained it to me in detail: The basic idea is
that if we have a tightly focussed laser pointing on the horizontal
plane, mostly perpendicular to the trap axis, then the dipole force in
the /z-direction/ (vertical) provides a modification to the radial
pseudo-potential in that direction. This modification in the
trap-depth is dependent on the ion's position on the axis due to the
gaussian profile of the beam. If the ion is close to saturation whilst
at the beam centre then it will be heated, and pushed away from the
centre as its wavefunction spreads and samples higher potentials
towards the centre. As it moves away it becomes less saturated, is
cooled more efficiently, and tries to return to its equilibrium
position in the centre of the beam. This is analagous to the Otto
cycle shown in PRL 109, 203006 (2012). 

My mistake was that I thought the dipole force in the axial direction
provided the oscillation motion, and so only regarded that, whilst
including heating dynamics in the other horizontal direction (y).

** Heat engine: correct layout					       :logs:
I have modified the simulation now so that it takes into account both
the trap axis and vertical direction, and the dipole force in both
directions (though the force in the axial direction should be largely
irrelevant). At first testing, I haven't managed to generate the
oscillatory motion observed in the experiment, but I am still playing
around with the specifics of the layout e.g. position of the laser and
parameters. 

Hiroki has suggested that I simplify the physics down to a two level
system until I can see the effect. This is a good suggestion since any
simulation takes a long time currently, which is not useful when
messing around with parameters.

** Measurement automation					       :logs:
Measurement automation programming in LabVIEW has mostly been
completed. I have vis for controlling the oven switching, N2 loading
via the pulse generator, and trap stability switching (for crystal
cleaning and ejection) via a four-way digital switch. The task that
remains is to actually test it.

* Wednesday 25th (Last entry of September)
** Heat engine: Next steps 					       :logs:
The meeting has highlighted the important points to tackle with this
simulation.

First and most obvious is that the dipole force is x1000 too weak in
my simulation. The approach to this problem will be to show Hiroki the
code and see if he can spot the error, as I have not been able to up
until now.

Next, my simulations don't show a strong dependence of the amplitude
of the motion on the detuning. The experiment shows that as detuning
decreases, the amplitude of motion increases. I think that this might
be an issue with the fact that I have only been changing the frequency
on a relatively small scale. Considering that experimental data was
taken with the wavemeter lock, it's possible that the detuning was
much larger to start with than my -0.5 \Gamma. Therefore I should try
larger detunings.

Last major issue is that I haven't looked in depth at the amplitude
dependence on power of the laser. This should be fairly easy to
do alongside plots of the dependence on detuning and position of the
beam.
