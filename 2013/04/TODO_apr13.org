* To do, Molecular Lab Experiments

** TODO [#B] Photoionisation of N2				    :Nic:Amy:
*** DONE Install pump and pump down PI test chamber			:Nic:
- <2013-04-15 Mon>
Installed and seems to be pumping down fine now with the turbo
on. 
*** DONE [#B] Get a PI spectrum from the test chamber		   :Jack:Nic:
- [X] Try out the newly serviced laser. | Jack's tuned it up and
  producing a good amount of power 1 mJ (of 4 mJ new) <2013-04-23 Tue>
- <2013-04-23 Tue>
Jack's got a preliminary spectrum. Needs tuning.
*** TODO [#B] Identify gnd-state transition
** DONE [#C] Dipole force laser setup					:Amy:
*** DONE AM setup
*** DONE New laser
- <2013-02-18 Mon>
Set up and lasing at correct wavelength. Power is lower than the 100 mW
it is rated at with an external cavity, but we are not exactly at the
emission peak of the bare diode (took a lot of tuning away from the
place with easiest optical feedback). Further, the bare diode is rated
at 200 mA, but I'm not sure how high I can run it with an external
cavity. 
 
λ = 787.475 nm,

I_{th} ~ 45 mA,

T = 25.36^{\circ} C,

I = 77.54 mA,

[X] Overlap/contrast ratio roughly optimised (80 %)

[C] Replace main arm mirror/PZT for dichroic and cylinder piezo (397
nm input) -> No zero deg. dichroics, setup will inc. two 45 deg
ones. instead - more complicated, more losses but too expensive
otherwise | <2013-04-09 Tue>

*** TODO [#C] Hand over to Amy
** TODO [#C] Work on DACs for the new SCL			  :Nic:Kevin:
*** TODO Building boards
- <2013-01-25 Fri> Matthias has the plans:
Pester him for them.
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Received:
Matthias sent them ages ago, but I didn't spot them in my mail. He's
still yet to order the actual DACs though, so there's still time. I
could make the boards however, in preparation.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Matthias is making the boards:
Matthias is making the boards, I think it'll just be up to me to
program the whole thing.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Pins used:
Check with Matthias that his design has incorporated these pins as
I/Os:
+ Port D: RD8 (peak detect input), RD5 (CN_interrupt)
+ U2RX pins, unless he's already designed these away
*** TODO Programming
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with computer
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with DAC

** TODO [#B] Code an automation program for experiments		  :Nic:Kevin:
*** DONE Flow chart for experimental sequence
- <2013-04-16 Tue>
Gave this to Kevin a while back. 

*** DONE Fix datasocket bug
- <2013-04-16 Tue>
Debugged. Not a problem with the datasocket. Rather I was not
resetting the function socket after it had been called, causing the
program to constantly be calling functions, and this messed up the
p7888 server. 
*** DONE [#B] Debug the rest of the program
- <2013-04-23 Tue>
Program debugged
*** TODO [#B] Write data extraction vi
- <2013-04-23 Tue>
Look back at notes as to how this was done.
*** TODO [#B] Fast autocorrelation calculation
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
[ ] Try using CUDA for a fast autocorrelation calculation | <2013-04-09 Tue>
*** TODO Contact FAST ComTec
About the issue with having to communicate with the card via the
server. 
** TODO [#B] Simulations 						:Nic:
*** TODO [#B] One or two calcium ions
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?
*** TODO [#B] 2-laser motional amplification for stable oscillation
c.f. Matter-wave laser paper from Thomas Udem 
*** CNCL Adiabatic switching on/off of the cooling laser
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Optimal parameters for adiabatic switching in order to avoid `kicking'
the ions when switching between cooling and optical-dipole force and
amplification periods. What is the typically used function?
- <2013-04-05 Fri>
This optimisation can be done experimentally, there's no need for a
simulation really.

** Find submissions for ITCM-Sussex.com
- <2012-11-13 Tue>
Matthias has reminded us to look through the old website for these.

- <2012-11-20 Tue> 
I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page
of the site (extended abstract?).
  
Furthermore, I think it'd be nice to look over the diagrams that are
on there already, and think about whether or not I could make some
improved ones in POVRAY.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

- <2013-01-04 Fri> Comments on current webpage:
1. There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
2. Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
3. Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?

** Ask Hiroki for a look at the code for cavity mode prop.
- <2012-11-06 Tue>  
Asked Hiroki, but he hasn't finished it yet. 

** Oxford group proposal research
- <2012-12-05 Wed>
  * Drewsen group BBR assisted cooling
  * Previous ammonia research
  * Ammonia level structure for state-detection
- <2012-12-10 Mon>
  * Drewsen and Schiller both have papers on BBR according to the proposal.
  * Drewsen proposal uses Raman transitions, requiring narrow/stable
    lasers - does this apply to our system?
- <2012-12-17 Mon>
E-mail Brianna to assess the status of the Stark decelerator.
- <2013-01-03 Thu> General:
Look closer at the reactions that are proposed to investigate in the
proposal, and make sure that there are going to be setups for those
experiments, or ones to do with our research here, at Oxford.

- Reactions -> Deuterium fractionation:
Reactions involving H atom transfer to ionic species e.g.:
: Ca^+ + HD0 -> CaH^+(CaD^+) + OD(H)
: Nd_3^+ + HDO -> ND_4^+(ND_3H^+) + OH(OD)

Addition reactions with H atom elimination (e.g. in [[file:~/Documents/literature/proposals/ProjectDescription.pdf][proposal]]), and
Near-thermoneutral charge transfer reactions (e.g. at link).

- Experimental:
In-situ measurement of masses and numbers of reactants and
products -> Monitor sequential isotopic exchange.

Quantum-state selected reactants from stark decelerator (neutrals) and
REMPI (ions). Thermal redistribution of ions monitored by
non-destructive state-detection.

Control internal states using BBR assisted schemes (see [[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/nphys1604.pdf][nphys1604]] and
[[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/nphys1605.pdf][nphys1605]]).
