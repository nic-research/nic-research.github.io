<p>I've done nothing except UI cleanups and usability improvements since
yesterday. The client has been changed a little so that it can run
without starting the p7888 automatically. That means that the user can
change settings `offline' so to speak, before running a measurement
and taking data.
</p>
<p>
In fact that's just given me an idea. The client need not really be
just a PMT if we use this idea. Essentially it can just be a total
client interface with all the functionality of the p7888: Before
running a measurement the user can set up everything as he pleases
using the settings of the p7888 and the client. That means we can
build in all functionality, such as live-rate checking (PMT-mode) or
data spectrum-taking, and let the user decide which functionality he
wants on a case-by-case basis. 
</p>
<p>
I wonder if this is the right approach, or having separate vis is
better. On the one hand we have "do one thing well",XC and on the other
hand we have repeated work and re-learning. In any case it's not
difficult to build the all-in-one unit, so I might see how far I can
get on that.

<p>Settings-writing has been fixed. The DDE module takes one command at a
time, so the client must send an array of strings with the settings
options to the server, and the server loops over that array to write
the settings. Right now the UI is just a textbox, but that can change
some time further down the line.

<p>The last known major issue in the software has been settled. This was
a timing issue, where the client would issue a datasocket request for
settings/data, and try and read it before the returning datasocket
write could be published. The obvious answer was to add a small timing
delay after the request, and everything works fine now.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to do a little bit of cleaning up, test the client as being
used remotely (have been running client and server on the same
computer up until now), and then add the whole thing to Hiroki's SVN
repository for use on other computers.

<p>In brief, I wrote a module on the server to extract data from the
p7888, and it works fine. The client asks for the data, the server
asks the card what the spectrum size is and returns the data to the
client. 
</p>
<p>
However this highlighted a bug in the settings-writing module where
the spectrum length is set. The value given to the card by the server
is not being written at all. Interestingly the server doesn't realise
this, as it receives back from the card that it has been written -
only on the card itself the value hasn't changed. I believe this is an
issue with the order of the data in the labview cluster and the
structure of the acqSetting struct in the dll. I haven't managed to
resolve this and so am instead changing tack. 
</p>
<p>
In place of this module I'm going to use the provided labVIEW DDE
modules for communicating with the card. These are likely to be slow,
and don't provide all of the functionality of the dll, but that is
okay if it's only being used to write settings at the start of
operation.
</p>
<p>
I've finished a first draft of the server-side module, and just need
to build an input into the client.
</p>
<p>
One more thing to note is that there's a small sync issue with the
client and server. It seems that the data that the client receives
from the server is always one step behind what is being asked i.e. I
must ask the server for the current settings twice in order to see any
changes that I made before the first call. I'll tackle this problem
once I have the basic functionality down.

<p>It seems I haven't reported having got a basic version of the software
running in the end. Paring the system down to one that only starts the
card, reads the status and stops the card (no settings writing or
reading), I managed to get a reading of the output of a function
generator hooked up to the Manati (cavity lab computer) p7888 card. 
</p>
<p>
The reason why there was no update on previous versions was probably
that I was pointing to the wrong dll. On both Manati and Marvin the
correct one is 
</p>
<pre class="example">
C:\Windows\System32\DP7888.dll
</pre>


<p>
Still now, there's an issue when I run the full PMT software, that
writes the settings at start and when they change, and reads the
settings every timeout loop. Not sure what the issue is just yet, but
it causes both lv and the server to crash. Potentially it's an issue
with volume of commands?

<h4 id="sec-4-1-2">13:41</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-2">

<p>It was, in fact, an issue with the volume of commands. I wrote a small
vi that checks the number of commands in the function buffer, and
just loops until it is empty. This was then built in to all of the
low-level, function-calling vis that make up the client. It now works
fine, if a little slowly. The slowness can't much be helped without
some serious rewrites and a solution to the double-server problem (my
LV vi is a server for the P7888 server).

<p>I didn't have any immediate luck adding client-side buffering to the
system yesterday. It's difficult to tell what was going wrong, but the
status of the card was not updating on the server or client properly
(i.e. tracking the amount of time the measurement had been on etc.). I
think there's likely some issues in synchronisation further up the
line, that is between the LV server and the P7888 server, which I
can't do anything about. 
</p>
<p>
I can try and make the buffering more robust though, by asking the
server to check the buffer length, and to execute commands as long as
the buffer is not empty.

<p>The quick fix mentioned above isn't quite enough to get things running
properly. There are many situations where client-side, we would like
to call a series of functions in succession. Since the server updates
independently of the client, there is not guarantee that functions
calls have been read by the server before the next function call is
written by the client. 
</p>
<p>
For this reason we need to have a ready/received flag set by the
server. Now every time the client loads a vi that calls a function, it
must first wait for the server flag to be set before sending the
function. The server sets the ready flag&hellip;

<div id="outline-container-6-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-6-1-2">16:06</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-1-2">

<p>Got caught in the middle of an entry there. Probably a good thing
though, since having thought it over, the application of this kind of
synchronisation is going to be more complicated than the track I
started off with above. It will essentially need two variables, a
ready and a received. The client then only sends when it reads ready,
and only moves on when it reads received. I suppose the same could be
accomplished with one variable, and detecting a change of state of
that, but anyway this is all rather complicated, when there appears to
be an easier solution: client-side data buffering. 
</p>
<p>
Using client-side data-buffering, we can make sure that the server
receives each command in turn, and as long as it refreshes at the same
rate or faster than the client, we can probably be sure of never
filling the buffer or missing a command. We should do some work to
make the server run as fast as possible in order to give this method
good responsiveness, but it's by far the easiest approach to this
problem at the moment.

<p>I finally debugged the error on my labview p7888 server. I was getting
a non-specific datasocket error that would crash it, when trying to
communicate using the client on another computer. It turns out that
the error was not in fact a datasocket error, but rather a programming
error. 
</p>
<p>
The problem was that the server would read the `function id' variable
to check if it was non-zero and if it was, then it would execute that
function. However the function id variable was not being reset
client-side (it cannot be reset server side because of
write-restrictions). I'm not 100% sure how, but this messed up the
datasocket protocol and gave me the error I was seeing. Perhaps it had
something to do with functions being repeatedly called. 
</p>
<p>
The quick-fix was to change the server code so that it would look for
a <i>change</i> in the `function id' before executing it. As long as the
function id is initialised as none, this has the same effect and is
robust against the issue I was having.

<p>During a previous meeting, Matthias proposed that we use a technique
similar to the one shown here:
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n9/full/nphys1367.html">http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n9/full/nphys1367.html</a>, instead
of the standard sequential amplification and cooling scheme we
initially planned.
</p>
<p>
The basic outline is that we use the dipole force to seed an
oscillation, amplify it using the blue detuned laser, and then
<i>stabilise</i> that oscillation by simultaneously increasing the power of
a red detuned cooling laser. Ideally then we would be able to maintain
a stable oscillation, seeded by a single shot of the dipole force, for
long enough to measure the oscillation frequency. This means we only
need a single shot per measurement, instead of many
dipole force -&gt; amplification -&gt; cooling sequences. This potentially
decreases the amount of time we need to have the molecule exposed to
the dipole laser, and thereby suppresses unwanted spontaneous
emission.
</p>
<p>
The problem I see with this at the moment is that the oscillation seen
in the paper above is self-seeded. Thus for a single experiment we
cannot distinguish an oscillation seeded by the dipole force from an
self-seeded one. One way around this is to use multiple shots, and
then phase information can be extracted from the correlations - but
then we are back to multiple shots, but with a more complicated setup
(lasers need to be more stable to maintain oscillations). 
</p>
<p>
I wonder if another possibility is to mix the photon signal with the
driving voltage, to pick out the part at the correct phase. There is
still a danger, I fear, of false positives in the event that the
random self-seeded phase happens to match that of the driving
force. The likelihood greatly diminishes if we add just a second shot
of the experiment however i.e. this could have better scaling with the
number of shots than other methods.

<p>It was my initial understanding of this method (before any of this
write-up) that helped to push us towards investigating this method in
Kevin's trap. Having thought over it since, I'm thinking that that
understanding was flawed. Here's the though process:
</p>
<p>
We cool the ion in the trap, and expose it to both a red and a blue
detuned laser on the cooling transition. The power ratio of these
lasers is tuned so as to sit just below the threshold of oscillation
(see the paper above). If the molecule is in the ground state, then
when the dipole force is applied, this kicks the oscillation into
motion and keeps it maintained. If the molecule is in another state,
nothing else happens.
</p>
<p>
I think this reasoning is flawed because the oscillation threshold is
fixed only by the power ratio, and not by the size of the
oscillation. Although increasing the amplitude of oscillation of the
ion the trap will increase the amplitude of the force acting on it
from the blue detuned laser, it will also increase the amplitude of
the force acting on it from the <i>red</i> laser, and thus the ratio of
amplitudes is maintained and no oscillation occurs.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, just thought I'd write that down so that I don't make the
same mistake again.

<p>For fast processing of the data we're receiving from the experiment we
need a quick autocorrelation algorithm. I think Wolfgang's code is
likely to be as fast as possible without using parallel processing,

looking into using parallel processing with GPUs. NVidia have released
a programming interface for general processing with their GPUs called
CUDA, and there is also an open source approach, which can use
non-nVidia GPUs, called `opencl'.

<p>Handing this over to Kevin to work on. I've shown him the
server/client LV program I wrote, and he's going to try and crack the
datasocket problem I was having. First off he's working on an
interesting idea Matthias had on amplifying the dipole force motion:
If we illuminate the ions with a red and blue laser simultaneously,
then perhaps, by tuning the powers of the two lasers in the same way
as in the matter-laser paper (Udem), we can stabilise the oscillation
and keep it going `indefinitely'. This would mean that we would
require only a single dipole force excitation, and could follow this
up with just a single measurement period. This would be ideal for
minimising the probablity of spontaneous decay.
</p>
<p>
The next point is that I've realised that I never thought of a method
for extracting a live list-file (timestamps of photon arrivals) from
the p7888. That's alright however, because this is functionally
equivalent to extracting a live spectrum from the machine, with it
measuring in `continuous' mode. We can get the same time-resolution by
setting bin-widths to 1, and we extract times by multiplying bin-width
by channel. This is in fact better than timestamps, because it's
already in a useful format for calculating auto-correlations.

The main difference will be that the main-arm's PZT-mirror assembly
must allow for optical access of a 397 nm cooling laser for axial
cooling (see fig. <a href="#fig-dipole_int_trap">dipole<sub>int</sub><sub>trap</sub></a>). Additionally, the fibre
outcoupling lens for the 787 and the first focussing lens (L1) will be
achromatic doublets. This will allow us to overlap the dipole-force
laser with the ions by passing 866 through the path and using it to
repump/illuminate ions. Once aligned this is turned off, and repumping
is done from the radial direction, in order that the 866 light does
not interfere with the interferometer.

<p>At a previous meeting I raised the idea that, at least for the first
experiments into detecting the dipole force, we might have two Ca ions
in the trap with the N2+, rather than just one. On the one hand this
will reduce the acceleration from the dipole force due to the
increased mass of the crystal, but on the other hand it will increase
the signal-to-noise ratio of the doppler velocimetry. Just from a
hand-wavey perspective I'd expect the gains to be higher than the loss
(maybe double signal to noise vs one-third reduction in translation of
force to movement?).
</p>
<p>
In order to get a better idea of this trade-off in reality, I can
build a simulation based on the molecular dynamics sims I've been
using so far. There is a whole other level of complexity involved when
we introduce multiple bodies to the system, but it's a generally
useful simulation, and perhaps one that can be generalised for large
numbers (e.g. 3-d ion crystals). Furthermore it might become a good
excuse for looking at coding using CUDA, which is a toolset for
parallel programming using 3-d graphics cards.

<p>Interferometer was succesfully locked yesterday. I used one of the old
modular, rack-mounted lock-boxes for PI feedback. The locking signal
has one major source of noise at 250 Hz, with an amplitude of 0.2
V. The complete fringe amplitude is 8 V pk-pk. Beneath the 250 Hz
noise, the signal is much cleaner at roughly 50 mV noise amplitude or
less. These amplitudes correspond roughly to &gt; 10 nm and &gt; 2.5 nm (
the "&gt;" coming from the non-linearity of the sinusoid).
</p>
<p>
Points of note:
a) The full range of the amplifier (160 V) is just under
one wavelength on the secondary PZT. This is less than expected, but
possibly not a terrible thing, as it makes us robust to electronic
noise in that arm. It may however cause problems in obtaining the best
locking signal for a specific overlap of the standing wave with the
ion. 
</p>
<p>
b) The feedback signal does not change drastically over time,
indicating that there is not a large amount of drift in either of the
PZTs extension. What drift there is, I would imagine would be much
more likely to come from the longer, less stiff PZT on the main
arm. There's no real way to test this in the current setup of course,
so maybe I should keep that in mind.

<p>The dipole force laser must come in through the trap axis in order for
us to look at the axial secular motion (least noisy). We also need
cooling lasers in this direction, so I need to replace the
retro-reflecting mirror on the main arm with a dichroic mirror
(transparent for 397 nm) in order to get the cooling beam in. There
must also be a a dichroic mirror for picking off the cooling beam
before it hits the interferometer diode. 
</p>
<p>
There will likely be some issues with overlapping the dipole force
with the ions. One suggestion is to couple an 866 to the same fibre
that the 787 comes from, and using achromatic optics, to overlap the
beams by looking for ion fluorescence from repumping. The achromatic
optics are necessary to overcome issues with dispersion between the
different wavelengths. 
</p>
<p>
For fine adjustment, once overlap is achieved, there is some
consideration of installing a thick glass plate on an adjustment

<p>The photodiode size ended up not being the real issue. More important
was that the diode was being saturated when pointed at regions of
highest contrast. Regions where the intensity were smaller were
naturally lower contrast (overlap is worse in the wings), and so the
contrast ratio was low. I found a less sensitive photodiode that can
look directly at the beam, and have found a roughly 88% contrast

<p>The electronics for the interferometer should at first iteration be
fairly simple. All we need is a low pass filter to filter out the AM
at ~ 1 MHz, and a simple PID to feedback to the main arm's PZT for
compensation of acoustic noise. The control for this arm must also
have a variable offset.
</p>
<p>
The second arm's PZT must be hooked up to a PZT-amp as well, but
there's not a lot of testing we can do as far as that's
concerned. This will allow us to fix the phase at the interferometer
output when we are required to change the offset of the PZT on the
main arm to overlap the standing wave with the ion.

We might need to scavenge/buy another PZT amplifier to get all of this

<p>Checked the polarisation of the beam coming out of the PM fibre. It
was so scrambled as to be impossible to optimise on the
polarimeter. One contribution to this was the fact that I was using a
waveplate for 794 nm (not 787 nm). But once that was fixed, and the
input to the fibre was confirmed to be purely polarised, the fibre
itself was found to be very bad at PM, with the best attenuation I
could manage at 8 deg (maximum ellipticity 20 deg). 
</p>
<p>
I swapped that fibre out for a brand new one from Thorlabs and it was
exactly the same. A third fibre (exact same model, new) was a lot
better, but still not as good as I would expect - it gives 17 dB
attenuation (prefer upwards of 20 dB).
</p>
<p>
Even after `fixing' these polarisation issues the contrast is still
almost exactly the same. My current thinking is that this is an issue
with the extension of the detector surface: If we look at the
interference on a card, it seems clear that there is a much larger
contrast than is measured on the oscilloscope, but it comes in `bands'
across the spot of the overlapped beams. If the size of the detector
is much larger than these bands, or if it is not aligned perpendicular
to the wavefronts,  then we can expect there to be a limit to the
contrast ratio obtainable.
</p>
<p>
The cure would be to either image the spots through a pin-hole, or use
a PD with a very small surface (more efficient than the former).

<p>Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:
</p>
<p>
"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.
</p>
<p>
By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."
</p>
<p>
Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(<a href="http://www.microchip.com/">http://www.microchip.com/</a>). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

</li>
<li>There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
</li>
<li>Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
</li>
<li>Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?
