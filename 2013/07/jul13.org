* To do: Molecule lab 
** HOLD Photoionisation of N2					    :Nic:Amy:
*** TODO Explain photoionisation process
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Draw up diagram with our options, write-up including selection rules
(see Matthias).
*** HOLD Replace damaged optical elements in laser
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Waiting on parts
*** HOLD Build power supply for discriminator preamp
*** HOLD Re-take spectra with better S-N
** HOLD Work on DACs for the new SCL				  :Nic:Kevin:
*** HOLD Building boards
- <2013-01-25 Fri> Matthias has the plans:
Pester him for them.
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Received:
Matthias sent them ages ago, but I didn't spot them in my mail. He's
still yet to order the actual DACs though, so there's still time. I
could make the boards however, in preparation.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Matthias is making the boards:
Matthias is making the boards, I think it'll just be up to me to
program the whole thing.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Pins used:
Check with Matthias that his design has incorporated these pins as
I/Os:
+ Port D: RD8 (peak detect input), RD5 (CN_interrupt)
+ U2RX pins, unless he's already designed these away
*** HOLD Programming
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with computer
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with DAC

** TODO [#B] Code an automation program for experiments		  :Nic:Kevin:
*** TODO [#B] Fast autocorrelation calculation
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
[ ] Try using CUDA for a fast autocorrelation calculation |
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
Maybe first just try using Wolfgang's code. It might just be fast
enough on its own.
*** HOLD [#C] Plan out experiment process
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Waiting on Keving to collect some data on `phonon-laser' type
amplification of the dipole force before we can decide on the exact
experimental procedure. 
*** HOLD [#C] Describe phonon laser trick in notes
- <2013-05-15 Wed>
Check if I already have.
- <2013-06-10 Mon>
Only really required if it turns out to be usable. Waiting on Kevin's
results. 
** TODO [#C] Simulations						:Nic:
*** TODO [#C] N2 PI spectrum simulation
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Not currently matching for high rotational levels - contact Anthony
McCaffery or Tim Softley for advice?
*** TODO [#B] Single ion `heat-engine' effect
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Does the oscillation have something to do with a kind of `parametric'
excitation from the laser pressure - Perhaps the ion only feels force
from the laser when it is at the edges of its oscillation (no Doppler
shift).
*** TODO [#B] Hanle dip/b-field map simulation
**** TODO [#C] Fluorescence as a function of B-field for different light pol.
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Done for now, need to talk about Matthias about results seen.
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Need to find a way of combining maps from different polarisations and
directions to give independent B-field direction data.
*** HOLD [#C] One or two calcium ions
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?
- <2013-05-28 Tue>
This question is not important if the `phonon-laser'-like approach
we're going to try and take works well. This idea is on hold until
more work is done there.

* To do: General
** HOLD Pseudopotential calculations for Oxford
- <2013-06-07 Fri>
Sent to Laura, awaiting feedback on usage.
** HOLD Find submissions for ITCM-Sussex.com
- <2012-11-13 Tue>
Matthias has reminded us to look through the old website for these.

- <2012-11-20 Tue> 
I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page
of the site (extended abstract?).
  
Furthermore, I think it'd be nice to look over the diagrams that are
on there already, and think about whether or not I could make some
improved ones in POVRAY.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

- <2013-01-04 Fri> Comments on current webpage:
1. There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
2. Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
3. Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?

** HOLD Ask Hiroki for a look at the code for cavity mode prop.

Asked Hiroki, but he hasn't finished it yet.
