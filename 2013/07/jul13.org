** N_{2} photoionisation
*** Fitting made by Chris Rennick				   :Analysis:
During our collaboration meeting on the 24^{th} Chris brought up a
program for simulating molecular spectra called PGOPHER
(http://pgopher.chm.bris.ac.uk/). He said it's hard to configure and
get up and running, but once done it's fairly easy to tweak and change
spectra to match different sets of data. 

Using the N_{2} constants from the NIST chemistry webbook, Chris fit
our data very nicely, as shown below:

[[file:N2PI/chris_fits/plot.pdf][file:N2PI/chris_fits/plot.pdf]]

I haven't yet determined what makes the difference between our model,
but it bears looking into. At first glance the transition assignments
are the same as ours (the P_{2} transition of our model fits the P_{2}
transition of the PGOPHER model), but according to Chris the spectra
are offset by approximately 0.03 nm (-13 cm^{-1}). 

I believe that the rotational constants of the model for the excited
state are calculated, so I wonder if there's a chance that we could
publish the measured constants according to our data.

** Measurement automation
*** Current status						       :logs:
The automation software is nearly complete. I've designed it as a
state machine that follows the states and transitions shown below:

[[file:img/measurement_automation.png]]

It's not yet clear whether or not the /crystal cleaning/ state can be
used to also eject non-N_{2}/Ca ions that contaminate the crystal. If so,
then for the most part the /crystal cleaning/ can replace the /eject
ions/ (except in the case where we've loaded too many ions).

The parts of the software that still need programming are the parts
that control lasers and other hardware, as we don't yet know the exact
layout, but there are placeholder VIs in those places that can be
swapped out when required. The other part that has not quite been
finished is the autocorrelation calculation. 

*** Autocorrelation calculation					       :logs:
The autocorrelation calculation will probably be made using a
variation of Wolfgang's original code for that purpose. The variation
is Hiroki's, where he has factored Wolfgang's single, multi-purpose
function into many smaller functions that achieve different parts of
the correlation process.

Right now the FFT is calculated using a LabVIEW VI, but it might be
necessary to use a c dll for speed. 

At one point, I tried running the FFT with a python script on an old
set of data, but it was painfully slow. It might not be fair to test
it without also testing the c-code, and on the computer we aim to
analyse on, but as a preliminary estimation, python is too slow.

** Simulations
*** Hanle experiment 						       :logs:
Kevin has tried to take a quick look at the parameter space I advised
in the notes of [[file:~/Documents/logs/2013/06/jun13.org::*Friday%2021st][Friday 21st]], but had no luck in seeing another
fluorescence feature with varying B-field, or a change in the
frequency response.

However, noting his recent findings on the stability of the wavemeter
lock (minimum 20 MHz fast drift), it's hard to say whether or not
we're really stable enough to pick out that parameter space. I think
it might be worthwhile looking at the experiment again in Amy's trap,
with the laser locked to the atom in Kevin's trap. 

*** Heat-engine experiment
I managed to write some code which I feel should incorporate the
dipole force into my 1D simulation. Matthias has also provided me
with some code too, and it would be useful to compare the two. Right
now the dipole force calculated from my simulation seems small, but I
need to make sure I get the scaling right and that there are no bugs
in the code.

* To do: Molecule lab 
** HOLD Photoionisation of N2					    :Nic:Amy:
*** TODO Explain photoionisation process
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Draw up diagram with our options, write-up including selection rules
(see Matthias).
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Some notes are in my logbook - need to write those up.
*** HOLD Replace damaged optical elements in laser
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Waiting on parts
*** DONE Build power supply for discriminator preamp
- <2013-07-31 Wed> 
Jack did this a couple of weeks ago, need to check whether or not that
has made a significant difference to the drift, but will likely do
this when we have fixed up the optical elements.
*** HOLD Re-take spectra with better S-N
** HOLD Work on DACs for the new SCL				  :Nic:Kevin:
*** HOLD Building boards
- <2013-01-25 Fri> Matthias has the plans:
Pester him for them.
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Received:
Matthias sent them ages ago, but I didn't spot them in my mail. He's
still yet to order the actual DACs though, so there's still time. I
could make the boards however, in preparation.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Matthias is making the boards:
Matthias is making the boards, I think it'll just be up to me to
program the whole thing.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Pins used:
Check with Matthias that his design has incorporated these pins as
I/Os:
+ Port D: RD8 (peak detect input), RD5 (CN_interrupt)
+ U2RX pins, unless he's already designed these away
*** HOLD Programming
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with computer
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with DAC

** TODO [#B] Code an automation program for experiments		  :Nic:Kevin:
*** TODO [#B] Fast autocorrelation calculation
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
[X] Try using CUDA for a fast autocorrelation calculation 
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
Maybe first just try using Wolfgang's code. It might just be fast
enough on its own.
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Hiroki has refactored Wolfgang's code into sub-functions and I'm now
using his DLL. I tried running a few tests with python but it's really
way too slow for large datasets.
*** DONE Plan out experiment process
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Waiting on Keving to collect some data on `phonon-laser' type
amplification of the dipole force before we can decide on the exact
experimental procedure. 
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
This is more or less irrelevant. I've built the automation program
around a design that doesn't much care what the measurement process
is, which is really the only  main variable. 
*** CNCL Describe phonon laser trick in notes
- <2013-05-15 Wed>
Check if I already have.
- <2013-06-10 Mon>
Only really required if it turns out to be usable. Waiting on Kevin's
results. 
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Not needed until the paper is written.
** TODO [#C] Simulations						:Nic:
*** DONE N2 PI spectrum simulation
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Not currently matching for high rotational levels - contact Anthony
McCaffery or Tim Softley for advice?
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Chris Rennick has plotted these out for us nicely, see the log entry
for today.
*** TODO [#B] Single ion `heat-engine' effect
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Does the oscillation have something to do with a kind of `parametric'
excitation from the laser pressure - Perhaps the ion only feels force
from the laser when it is at the edges of its oscillation (no Doppler
shift).
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Still working on this, but got the dipole force nearly in
properly. Need to compare ways of calculating dipole force to make
sure they agree. If we don't see the effect with a 1D model, then
maybe we need to think about a 3D model (which Matthias reckons is the
only model that should fit). 
*** HOLD [#B] Hanle dip/b-field map simulation
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Waiting on Kevin to make some measurements to see if they match my
simulations. 
**** HOLD [#C] Fluorescence as a function of B-field for different light pol.
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Done for now, need to talk about Matthias about results seen.
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Need to find a way of combining maps from different polarisations and
directions to give independent B-field direction data.
*** HOLD [#C] One or two calcium ions
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?
- <2013-05-28 Tue>
This question is not important if the `phonon-laser'-like approach
we're going to try and take works well. This idea is on hold until
more work is done there.

* To do: General
** DONE Pseudopotential calculations for Oxford
- <2013-06-07 Fri>
Sent to Laura, awaiting feedback on usage.
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Laura and Chris used these succesfully.
** HOLD Find submissions for ITCM-Sussex.com
- <2012-11-13 Tue>
Matthias has reminded us to look through the old website for these.

- <2012-11-20 Tue> 
I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page
of the site (extended abstract?).
  
Furthermore, I think it'd be nice to look over the diagrams that are
on there already, and think about whether or not I could make some
improved ones in POVRAY.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

- <2013-01-04 Fri> Comments on current webpage:
1. There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
2. Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
3. Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?
