** Molecular Lab Experiments
*** HOLD Photoionisation of N2					    :Nic:Amy:
**** HOLD Identify gnd-state transition
- <2013-05-08 Wed>
Jack has done most of the work here. Just a case of optimising power
etc. 
- <2013-05-14 Tue> 
Jack has had to move on to fibre shooting after some trouble with
getting a spectrum around the gnd-state transition. I'm going to take
over generally, once Matthias has reoptimised the laser and finished
baking the chamber (having just replaced the channeltron).
- <2013-05-31 Fri>
I managed to get a full spectrum on Wednesday and analyse it today. I
think we've got the whole series of lines, and I've handed it over to
Matthias to see if he can identify the ground state transition from
it.

**** DONE Install pump and pump down PI test chamber			:Nic:
- <2013-04-15 Mon>
Installed and seems to be pumping down fine now with the turbo
on. 
**** DONE Get a PI spectrum from the test chamber		   :Jack:Nic:
- [X] Try out the newly serviced laser. | Jack's tuned it up and
  producing a good amount of power 1 mJ (of 4 mJ new) <2013-04-23 Tue>
- <2013-04-23 Tue>
Jack's got a preliminary spectrum. Needs tuning.
*** DONE New tests on beamline
**** DONE Pulsing redo pulsing tests
- <2013-05-08 Wed>
I need to redo the tests that were done early January on the
beamline. That is, to test pulsing of N2 using variable pre-chamber
pressures and to make sure that the resulting pressure is low and that
we have a good range of control over it.
- <2013-05-13 Mon>
Redone, and all much the same as last time. Next up is to open the
trap to the beamline and redo tests again.
**** [#B] Open trap to beamline
- <2013-05-13 Mon>
Waiting on Amy to finish micromotion tests, then we open the gate
valve separating the beamline from the trap.
*** HOLD Work on DACs for the new SCL				  :Nic:Kevin:
**** HOLD Building boards
- <2013-01-25 Fri> Matthias has the plans:
Pester him for them.
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Received:
Matthias sent them ages ago, but I didn't spot them in my mail. He's
still yet to order the actual DACs though, so there's still time. I
could make the boards however, in preparation.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Matthias is making the boards:
Matthias is making the boards, I think it'll just be up to me to
program the whole thing.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Pins used:
Check with Matthias that his design has incorporated these pins as
I/Os:
+ Port D: RD8 (peak detect input), RD5 (CN_interrupt)
+ U2RX pins, unless he's already designed these away
**** HOLD Programming
***** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with computer
***** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with DAC

*** TODO [#C] Code an automation program for experiments	  :Nic:Kevin:
**** HOLD [#C] Plan out experiment process
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Waiting on Keving to collect some data on `phonon-laser' type
amplification of the dipole force before we can decide on the exact
experimental procedure. 
**** TODO [#C] Fast autocorrelation calculation
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
[ ] Try using CUDA for a fast autocorrelation calculation |
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
Maybe first just try using Wolfgang's code. It might just be fast
enough on its own.
**** TODO [#C] Describe phonon laser trick in notes
- <2013-05-15 Wed>
Check if I already have.
**** DONE Flow chart for experimental sequence
- <2013-04-16 Tue>
Gave this to Kevin a while back. 

**** DONE Fix datasocket bug
- <2013-04-16 Tue>
Debugged. Not a problem with the datasocket. Rather I was not
resetting the function socket after it had been called, causing the
program to constantly be calling functions, and this messed up the
p7888 server. 
**** DONE Debug the rest of the program
- <2013-04-23 Tue>
Program debugged
**** DONE Write data extraction vi
- <2013-04-23 Tue>
Look back at notes as to how this was done.
- <2013-05-08 Wed>
This was easy to write. 

**** DONE Debug
- <2013-05-08 Wed>
Most components work generally but synchronisation issues cause a
problem running. Needs debugging.
- <2013-05-13 Mon>
Major debugging done, I'm sure more will turn up, but the test program
is broadly functional. Next step is to make specific programs for the
required tasks.
*** TODO [#B] Simulations						:Nic:
**** TODO [#B] Hanle dip/b-field map simulation
***** TODO Fluorescence as a function of B-field for different light pol.
***** TODO Sanity check: modulation sensitivity reduce at higher B-field?
***** TODO B-field modulation frequency response (reduce laser Rabi f.)
**** TODO [#C] Single ion `heat-engine' effect
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Does the oscillation have something to do with a kind of `parametric'
excitation from the laser pressure - Perhaps the ion only feels force
from the laser when it is at the edges of its oscillation (no Doppler
shift).
**** HOLD [#C] One or two calcium ions
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?
- <2013-05-28 Tue>
This question is not important if the `phonon-laser'-like approach
we're going to try and take works well. This idea is on hold until
more work is done there.
**** CNCL 2-laser motional amplification for stable oscillation
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
This is being investigated experimentally. Won't need a simulation if
it just works. Won't need a simulation if it doesn't.
**** CNCL Adiabatic switching on/off of the cooling laser
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Optimal parameters for adiabatic switching in order to avoid `kicking'
the ions when switching between cooling and optical-dipole force and
amplification periods. What is the typically used function?
- <2013-04-05 Fri>
This optimisation can be done experimentally, there's no need for a
simulation really.

*** Find submissions for ITCM-Sussex.com
- <2012-11-13 Tue>
Matthias has reminded us to look through the old website for these.

- <2012-11-20 Tue> 
I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page
of the site (extended abstract?).
  
Furthermore, I think it'd be nice to look over the diagrams that are
on there already, and think about whether or not I could make some
improved ones in POVRAY.

- <2012-11-26 Mon>
Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

- <2013-01-04 Fri> Comments on current webpage:
1. There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
2. Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
3. Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?

*** Ask Hiroki for a look at the code for cavity mode prop.
- <2012-11-06 Tue>  
Asked Hiroki, but he hasn't finished it yet. 

*** DONE Oxford group proposal research
- <2012-12-05 Wed>
  * Drewsen group BBR assisted cooling
  * Previous ammonia research
  * Ammonia level structure for state-detection
- <2012-12-10 Mon>
  * Drewsen and Schiller both have papers on BBR according to the proposal.
  * Drewsen proposal uses Raman transitions, requiring narrow/stable
    lasers - does this apply to our system?
- <2012-12-17 Mon>
E-mail Brianna to assess the status of the Stark decelerator.
- <2013-01-03 Thu> General:
Look closer at the reactions that are proposed to investigate in the
proposal, and make sure that there are going to be setups for those
experiments, or ones to do with our research here, at Oxford.

- Reactions -> Deuterium fractionation:
Reactions involving H atom transfer to ionic species e.g.:
: Ca^+ + HD0 -> CaH^+(CaD^+) + OD(H)
: Nd_3^+ + HDO -> ND_4^+(ND_3H^+) + OH(OD)

Addition reactions with H atom elimination (e.g. in [[file:~/Documents/literature/proposals/ProjectDescription.pdf][proposal]]), and
Near-thermoneutral charge transfer reactions (e.g. at link).

- Experimental:
In-situ measurement of masses and numbers of reactants and
products -> Monitor sequential isotopic exchange.

Quantum-state selected reactants from stark decelerator (neutrals) and
REMPI (ions). Thermal redistribution of ions monitored by
non-destructive state-detection.

Control internal states using BBR assisted schemes (see [[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/nphys1604.pdf][nphys1604]] and
[[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/nphys1605.pdf][nphys1605]]).
