In the course of this project we will develop a system to
deterministically transfer quantum information between distant nodes
of a `quantum-network'. Using optical fibres as a carrier,
quantum-bits (or qubits) of information will be transferred by
exchange of single photons (light-particles) between atomic ions. This
system is a fundamental building block for the quantum-network, which
will one day connect quantum computers in the same way the internet
does for present-day computers.

Single-photon exchanges are already used today to transmit information
securely over long distances. This process, called `quantum
communication', utilises the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics to
foil any possibility of eavesdropping. Quantum effects can also be
used to perform compuations much faster than is currently possible
with classical computers. In our project, we will combine the areas of
quantum computation and quantum communication by building an efficient
user-controlled interface (quantum link) between ions and photons and
thus develop a crucial building block for the future quantum internet.
