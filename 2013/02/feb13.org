** Dipole force interferometer
*** 16:32
Completed the single-pass AOM setup, but not coupling to a fibre. The
laser polarisation is 90 deg. to the AOM's more efficient axis, so
there's a half-waveplate in to correct. The total efficiency into the
first order is 67% giving 5 mW out.

** Hanle effect - time-dependent magnetic field
*** 09:04
I tried to run Matthias' code overnight to let it calculate dynamics
for relatively low frequencies (1E-6 \Gamma), using the same timesteps
as shorter simulations yesterday (10/\Gamma). I started with the
lowest frequency and left it running from about 5pm. The solver error
report says it failed right at the end of that first simulation, at
around 5:30pm. 

The solver error:
: reaching tout=1.88891e+06.

: SOLVEMC FAILED.
: CVode failed, flag=-3.

: FAIL
: SOLVEMC failed at Tue Feb 19 17:29:29 2013

: CVode failed, flag=-3.

Now I'm not sure what type of error this is (there's no documentation
on the command "SOLVEMC" that the solver calls), but it might have
something to do with memory. To that end, I'll try again but with
shorter lengths of time. The parameters for this were:

: tMax = 2000000
: N = 200000

which for omega = 1E-6 would have given two cycles. I could either try
and cut that down by a factor of two and see what happens, or try to
be a bit more clever in general, and save time by making the length of
the simulation depend on frequency.

*** 11:28
Re-wrote the simulation to do just what I mentioned above, and ran
again. Up to omega = 1E-5 the simulation runs fine, but breaks down
again at omega = 1E-6. Interestingly the error code again states that
the time it got to is roughly 1.89E+6, indicating that this has
something to do with the length of the simulation i.e. a memory
problem?

The error:
: CVode-- At t=1.89152e+06, mxstep=500 steps taken on this call before
: reaching tout=1.89153e+06.

: SOLVEMC FAILED.
: CVode failed, flag=-3.

: FAIL
: SOLVEMC failed at Wed Feb 20 11:23:48 2013

: CVode failed, flag=-3.

Given that the simulation timesteps have always been way larger than
Γ^{-1}, is there any reason that we shouldn't increase the simulation
timesteps? I'm not sure what this would get us, since up to omega =
1E-5 we don't see any indication of a change of the dynamics.

Instead I'm going to go for shorter timesteps (< 10 Γ^{-1}). This will
limit us to higher frequencies as well, but it's worth a shot in case
long timesteps are what's causing us not to see the changing dynamics.

*** 15:09

[[file:timestep0p1.png]]

Taking shorter timesteps doesn't seem to change the behaviour at the
frequencies we've been looking at -but- it does however allow us to
look at higher frequencies, on the order of Γ, and at these
frequencies we finally see the expected dropoff of amplitude.

It seems that everything slower than 0.1 Γ is not affected by the
dynamics of the atom, anything faster begins to be damped it. This can
be seen quite clearly in fig. \ref{fig:dt0p1}: the response curves for
0.001 Γ  and 0.01 Γ are approximately the same, and 0.1
Γ and 1 Γ reduce in amplitude.

Changing parameters to wildly different values (power, detuning of
both lasers) doesn't seem to affect this characteristic at all. I'm
leaning towards the theory that the dropoff we see in the experiment
is not due to this effect, or that we have not correctly modelled it.

** Dipole force interferometer
*** 17:12
The contrast of the interferometer using the free-space beam directly
from the laser is much worse than when we used the fibre. The output
mode is not very clean, so this is to be expected. I couldn't fix up
the output mode by optimising optical feedback (it was already as good
as it will get).

We are likely to need an optical fibre to get the beam from the laser
on the stable optics table to the trap, and this will act as a spatial
filter. For these reasons I'll couple the laser into a fibre and output
it on the same table at the test setup.

** Ion spectrum simulation for Hiroki's paper
*** 09:23
So many unknown parameters go towards Hiroki's plot that it's
difficult to get a proper simulation.

One of the main things to note however is that according to the
simulation, as soon as you get to a decent amount of cooling power, by
tuning close enough to line-centre, the fluorescence you get from
simulation (and thus experiment?) is very close to the natural
linewidth i.e. there's little contribution from Doppler broadening.

Another thing to note is that the lineshape and drop-off is fairly
closely dependent on the amount of time per simulation (see
fig. \ref{fig:H_expt_100us} and fig. \ref{fig:H_expt_1ms}). Since the
simulation runs fairly slowly, a tradeoff needs to be found between
accuracy and practical-run-time.


Considering, however, that the lineshape is probably well followed by
the experiment, then to tackle the criticism from the referee, all we
need to do is point out that it is perfectly possible, given certain
values of repumper detuning and power, to get a linewidth that doesn't
correspond to the natural, power-broadened linewidth of the
transition. This is simply down to efficiency of repumping and thus
artificial extension of the life-time of the excited state.

** Hanle effect - time-dependent magnetic field
*** 09:52
I've taken Matthias' code and cleaned it up a bit to run on my
computer. It runs the same and gives the same result: effectively no
change in response to B-field frequency between 1E-5 and 1E-2 Hz.
* <2013-02-18 Mon>
** Beam-line preparation
*** 14:27
Alan had the second skimmer finished this morning, so I finished
taking apart the beamline. Alan now has the 5-way cross to install the
skimmer to.

According to the plan, I'm handing over the rest of the build-up to
Kevin. He must be sure to have 6 CF60 (I think) gasketts, an adaptor
from CF60 to DN63 (that's the trap connection), and a gaskett for that
too.

** Ion spectrum simulation for Hiroki's paper
*** 16:23
Hiroki got the referee report back from New J. Phys. and got only a
few criticisms from one referee. One of these was that the setup is
claimed to be good for spectroscopy, but the linewidth of a spectrum
shown does not match the natural linewidth (including power
broadening) of Calcium. This seems fairly easily explained by the
spectroscopy technique being the imperfect, old technique of scanning
over the resonance without cooling periods. Since the trap is no
longer up we can't take a proper spectrum, but we can perhaps simulate
the system with my program and look for a match that we could use to
justify the claim.

I've repurposed my simulation for EIT cooling, which finds the
temperature for various detunings of either laser. I simply added a
calculation of the average and simulated fluorescence rates to match
with the data in the paper. 

*** 17:36
I also needed to make sure that the simulation tracked the position
and velocity between spectra (not necessary in previous use-case),
since starting from cold at each spectrum point is clearly not the
experimental circumstance.

On top of that I improved the calculation of temperature which was
probably going to be a little off (factor of 2?) since it didn't
include the potential energy.
* <2013-02-15 Fri>
** Building dipole force laser
*** 16:30
The laser diode is quoted as having TM polarisation, from what I can
tell that means that the polarisation lies along the fast axis. What
this means for the Littrow grating is that the diode must lie with the
fast axis on the horizontal since (unexpectedly), the efficiency curve
is much better for the grating with S-polarisation.

In this arrangement I have managed to set up the laser to have ~40 mA
threshold current, but it is at completely the wrong wavelength -
797nm rather than 787 nm. This likely means that I will have to tune
far away and have worse optical feedback, if the laser can get to that
wavelength at all.
*** 17:19
Laser tuned to 787.475 nm, the required wavelength. It took a fair bit
of coarse tuning with the grating, some tuning with the current, and a
little fine-tuning with the temperature. 

Power is lower than the 100 mW it is rated at with an external cavity,
but we are not exactly at the emission peak of the bare diode (took a
lot of tuning away from the place with easiest optical
feedback). Further, the bare diode is rated at 200 mA, but I'm not
sure how high I can run it with an external cavity.

λ = 787.475 nm,

I_th ~ 45 mA,

T = 25.36^{\circ} C,

I = 77.54 mA,

V_PZT = 107 V,

P ~ 10 mW, 
* <2013-02-13 Wed>
** Building dipole force laser
The required laser grating angle is too acute (from the norm). I'm
having Alan machine away some of the laser mount so that the beam can
get past it. 

I briefly had the equation for calculating the Littrow condition
wrong (forgot the factor of two), so here it is as a reminder:

\theta_1 = arcsin(\lambda/2d). 

With \lambda = 780 nm, d = 1/(1200 lines/mm),

\theta_1 = 28^{\circ}.
* <2013-02-12 Tue>
** Building dipole force laser
Regarding the 1 mW output power stated in yesterday's notes: That's
for the laser without an external cavity, which obviously isn't
lasing. Matthias has handed over a [[file:780_spec_2.pdf][document]] from Eagleyard which
includes the data in fig. \ref{fig:780_spec} and a statement of the
expected power with an external cavity, which is quoted as 100 mW @
200 mA.

** Building dipole force laser
The 780 nm laser that will ideally be used for actual state detection
of N2 has been put together. The temperature sensor and peltier
element work nicely, and I will test the diode itself tomorrow. The
controller pin assignments (fig. \ref{fig:curr_ctrl},
fig. \ref{fig:temp_ctrl}, and table \ref{tab:conn_9_15}) and laser
spec-sheet (fig. \ref{fig:780_spec}) are included in this
document. N.B. The max output power of the laser is roughly 1 mW at
170 mA, which seems quite low.

** Dipole force laser setup
#+CAPTION: Schematic of the dipole-force laser interferometer
[[file:dipole_interferometer.png]]

Dipole force laser has been set up nearly as shown in the diagram
above. Only the lock-phase PZT-mounted mirror (top) is not yet
installed. This will allow us to change the phase of the standing-wave
at the ion using the compensation PZT (right), while compensating for
the resulting change in the phase at the interferometer. This is
essential to maintaining the optimal slope of the error signal at the
interferometer i.e. we must be half-way up an interference fringe for
optimal sensitivity to changes in path length.

I managed to extract a decent interferometry signal from the setup
using a spare arm of the 866 laser, but that is now being used for
another experiment, so I might as well build the laser that will be
used in the ultimate setup.
* <2013-02-04 Mon>
** New DAC for SCL
Matthias is making the boards, I think it'll just be up to me to
program the whole thing.

Check with Matthias that his design has incorporated these pins as
I/Os:
+ Port D: RD8 (peak detect input), RD5 (CN\_interrupt)
+ U2RX pins, unless he's already designed these away

* <2013-02-01 Fri>
** Dipole force laser setup
If all we require is AM beam, then we can use a single-pass AOM to do
the job. 

Since we're not concerned about whether we modulate one beam,
or both, we can modulate the beam before splitting it, and then
recombine at the ion to give us our modulated standing wave.

The simplest way to achieve this is by retro-reflecting the incoming
beam with a mirror mounted on a PZT (for phase compensation), and
overlapping the reflection using the optical fibre. An interferometer
can be placed as close as possible to the trap in order to
monitor/lock the phase in conjunction with the PZT.

I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

- <2013-01-04 Fri> Comments on current webpage:
1. There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
2. Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
3. Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?
