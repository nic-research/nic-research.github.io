** Hanle experiment
*** 10:50 Modulation frequency response 			       :logs:
I've finally managed to arrange the parameters in the simulation so
that we see something like the frequency response observed in the
experiment. For these parameters, we see a very fast drop-off of the
amplitude of fluorescence modulation as the frequency of B-field
modulation on the edge of the Hanle dip is increased above a few kHz.

The parameters were found by copying, as close as possible, the
experimental [[*Hanle%20dip%20experiment%20parameters][parameters]] given to me by Kevin, and also by noticing
that although he applies a B-field to the experiment this is in order
compensate the earth's field and so the effective B-field is roughly
zero. 

One interesting thing about this set of parameters is that, because
the repumper Rabi frequency is so high (/~37 \Gamma/), we can see
interesting effects at relatively high B-field. I believe this
probably has to do with Rabi-splitting of the individual Zeeman
sub-levels, but I don't have a clear theoretical picture yet. The
effects are shown in three diagrams in the [[*Hanle%20dip%20regimes][appendix]], showing the
fluorescence for varying B in low-field, medium-field and high-field
regimes.

These diagrams show that apart from what we normally consider the
standard `Hanle-dip' feature at low B-field, there are further regions
of increasing fluorescence at medium and high B, including a feature
larger by orders of magnitude at around /250 gauss/.

*** 13:14 Continued						       :Logs:
At a guess, what we're seeing here is a very large Rabi splitting from
the high power of the 866 - the features seen in the diagram then
correspond to 397 resonances between specific Zeeman sub-levels as
they are `tuned' by the changing B-field. 

If this is the case then we certainly don't expect to see a low
frequency cut-off of the response - something that is backed up by
simulations showing that the frequency cutoff is much higher (of the
order of the decay rate of the P-state) when we modulate the B-field
around these features instead of the Hanle dip.

Furthermore, investigations into the parameters in the simulation show
that as we reduce the 866 power, the large peak shown in the high
B-field [[*High%20B-field][diagram]] is brought down so that it appears at much lower
B. This behaviour continues until it overlaps with the Hanle dip
effect (NB at this stage I have no good physical explanation of what's
happening, but am rather describing things empirically), at roughly
/\Omega_{re} ~ 1 \Gamma/. If we then look at the frequency modulation
response we find that although we get a lower drop-off than at high
866 power and B-field, we get a distinctly higher drop-off than around
the Hanle dip (low B) at high 866 power.

This is an easy test to put into practice in the experiment, and if it
works will greatly enhance the potential for publication of this
technique. 

*** 15:34 Final note 						       :Logs:
One final note on this experiment for the moment: Matthias has some
explanation of a quantum effect that could limit the frequency
response, which I can't remember right now. The upshot was that it
could be limited by the energy splitting of the Zeeman sub-levels, but
he made some calculations based on Kevin's numbers that indicated
that, if it were the case, the cutoff would be at higher
frequencies. 

It's possible however that Matthias used Kevin's estimates for the
total /applied/ field (estimated at between 1 and 10 /gauss/),
forgetting that this applied field is actually used to compensate the
magnetic fields inside the trap and that of the earth. 

If we use the total magnetic field then we might find indeed that the
energy splitting would be larger and expect a higher cut-off
frequency. If instead we assume that the field is compensated, and use
values of B from our simulation that give us maximum fluorescence
sensitivity on the Hanle dip (e.g. [[*Low%20B-field][/0.15 gauss/]]), we find that this
effect could well explain the cut-off observed.

* Tuesday 18th
** Hanle experiment
*** 16:37 B-field map: 3-dimensions 				       :logs:
I've changed up the simulation referred to yesterday to include
methods for simulating fluorescence change for B-fields that vary in
strength in all three dimensions ([[file:hanle_effect/Hanle_dip_nd_3d.m][full 3d here]], and [[file:hanle_effect/Hanle_dip_nd_slices.m][planes here]]). 

The ideal situation for this experiment would be such that we could
set up the polarisation and B-fields so that the fluorescence would
only be sensitive to variations of B in one particular direction. Once
mapped, we would then rearrange those parameters so that we could
probe the next two directions in turn. If the fluorescence is
sensitive to more than one direction at a time, then it becomes
difficult to tell anything more than the magnitude of the B-field
variations.

I have not yet been able to find a configuration where this kind of
response is observed. I think I need to think about how the
quantisation axis is defined in this case, and given that, whether or
not it is even theoretical possible to create that response. 

* Monday 17th 
** Hanle experiment
*** 15:16 Simulating a B-field map				       :logs:
As mentioned [[file:~/Documents/logs/2013/05/may13.org::*Hanle%20dip%20simulation][previously]], Matthias has asked me to take another look at
the simulation of the Hanle-dip experiment that Kevin performed a long
while back. Specifically he wanted to know whether we could simulate a
space-varying B-field map, so that we could take fluorescence data
from the experiment and create a picture of the magnetic fields in the
trap (he also wanted to see if we could simulate the ion's response to
a time-varying B-field but I will log details of that when I start
working on it in earnest). 

I went back to a Matlab simulation I had written whilst the experiment
was under way, which calculates the populations of the three states of
the lambda-system, but takes into account Zeeman-splitting, laser
polarisation and direction and varying B-field ([[file:hanle_effect/Hanle_dip_nd.m][script here]] and
[[file:hanle_effect/kevin_params.m][parameters]] used in the simulation, see appendix for [[*Hanle%20dip%20experiment%20parameters][more details]]). 

After debugging a little, I have found the simulation gives
reasonable, expected results - low fluorescence at low B-fields and a
linear region (where we set the background B-field for the experiment)
where we can ideally map fluorescence to local fields.

The question now is, how does varying B-fields in different directions
affect the fluorescence, and can we really make a meaningful map out
of what we see in the experiment.

** N2 Photionisation
*** 11:40 Scan analysis 					       :Data:
The scan taken yesterday finished fine, and I took another in the
reverse direction since I had the time. The second is not as nice,
perhaps because the power was dropping over time, as it does, or
because of the problem with the drifting channeltron voltage. 

The [[file:N2PI/12-6-13][data taken]] shows good agreement with previous scans, and shows an
additional line that is predicted by [[*16:13%20Fitting][our model]] - the /O_4/ line (seen
to the far right in the model figure). You can also see the splitting
in splitting in some branches where lines are close to overlapping
(e.g. /S_{4/5}/ and /S_{1/8}/).

The better of the two scans is shown below (the [[*Second%20N2%20photoionisation%20scan][second]] is shown in
the appendix), ([[file:N2PI/scripts/N2PI_plot1.py][python-script]]):

#+CAPTION: Figure 3, N2 photoionisation spectrum. 
#+CAPTION: Labels are derived from the paper (appendix), apart from
#+CAPTION: that of the /O_3/ and /O_4/ lines, which are predicted
#+CAPTION: by the model.
#+LABEL: fig:N2-PI-spectrum2
[[file:img/n2_scan18][file:img/n2_scan18.png]]

Lines which are not particularly clear in this scan are confirmed in
other scans (/S_{2/7}, Q_5 and O_3/). The relevant lines are the /O_3/
and /P_2/ with the /O_3/ more likely to be our first target for
photoionisation. This path likely leaves us in the /N = 1/ rotational
state of N2+, rather than the originally planned ground state, but the
selection rules for this transition are more strongly selective for
this state than n the transition to the ground state using /P_2/,
according to Matthias. 

The signal-to-noise ratio is not as good as expected given an increase
in laser power, and there seems to be significant jitter in the
wavelength reading. As well, despite the fact that the peaks seem to
have a fairly constant height between scans in the calibrations, the
signal to noise drifts significantly by the end of the second
scan. Regardless of these issues, I'm going to refrain from trying to
make any improvements to these issues, until we have some replacement
optical elements that are going to be installed in to the laser to
improve the power further. Once we have them installed, I'll change
the dye and try and get Mike's channeltron preamp working. 

* Wednesday 12th
** N2 Photionisation
*** 15:56 Optimisations and a wide scan				      :Setup:
Mike hasn't got back to me about the pre-amp yet. Luckily, I've done
some testing on the signal in the meantime, and it seems a lot more
stable than in previous scans.

Less positively, the signal does not seem to have improved a huge
amount compare the last set of scans, despite the power increasing by
about a half. 

I have tried to optimise using the channeltron voltage /V_ch/, the
discriminator voltage /V_disc/, and finally a small amount with the
pointing of the laser in the chamber. Optimisations found for the
first two were

V_ch = 2.9 kV,\\
V_disc = 0.20 mV.

This gives a signal of ~270 cps for the /Q_4/ line, with a background
of ~80 cps. I was in the middle of optimising the pointing when I
realised the power was dropping and decided it would be wise to take a
scan before it bottomed out. I noticed at the least that pointing the
laser any further down from its current position reduces the
signal. So if there's still good power after the scan then I will try
and optimise by raising it up. 

The scan I'm performing is made with the following parameters

\Lambda = (474.40 \to 474.0) nm,\\
\Delta \Lambda = 0.001 nm (4000 steps),\\
T_step = 10 s,\\
E_in = 1.5 mJ,\\
E_thru = 800 uJ,\\
P_chamber ~ 3E-5 mbar,\\
V_cap = 4 V,\\
V_ch = 2.9 kV,\\
V_disc = 0.2 mV.

Where /\Lambda/ is the range of wavelengths (N.B. There is an offset from thew
wavelength input written here and the one read from the wavemeter, it
is roughly 0.1 nm). /\Delta \Lambda/ is the wavelength steps of the
scan, /T_step/ is the time spent taking count rate data at each
wavelength,  /E_in/ is the pulse energy going into the chamber and
/E_out/ is the pulse energy coming out of it, P_chamber is the
pressure of N_2 in the chamber and V_cap is the voltage on the
repeller plate.

* Tuesday 11th
** N2 Photionisation
*** 16:16 Scan preparations						:Log:
I couldn't go ahead with the scans yesterday because the N2 canister
was empty. I don't know how it was emptied, but perhaps its due to one
of the many connections it has being leaky. Before the experiment I
will re-attach the output so that it is only going to the PI
experiment. 

Further, while I was waiting, I have set up the autotracker and found
that it can scan the full range that we are expecting to see lines
over (473.95 nm \to 474.30 nm) without significantly changing power.

Mike Hardiman says he's looking about for a pre-amplifier that he used
to use for the same channeltrons, and that should help us to get rid
of discriminator drift. If that's not here by tomorrow morning I will
go ahead and make a scan anyway.

* Monday 10th
** N2 Photionisation
*** 11:07 Laser optimisation					       :Log:
The laser has been attended by a technician and is running at
approximately the same power as during the last scans. At around
T(q-switch) = (150 \to 180) us, the pulse energy of the laser is (1.3
\to 1.5) mJ. The beam-profile looks marginally better. I am told that
we have ordered replacement prisms (used to separate the fundamental
from the frequency doubled light), which should increase the output
power to around 2.5 mJ. As mentioned previously, since the
photoionisation is a third-order process, the gains from these
improvements should be substantial. 

I'm going to try taking scans with the current setup. Again ignoring
the auto-tracker and instead adjusting the doubling-crystal angle
manually approximately every 0.05 nm.

(N.B. It seemed to me, from the behaviour of previous scans, that we
could do with improving the stability of the channeltron output signal
by adding a preamplifier before the discriminator, but I'm going to
hold off on that for the moment just in case the increase in signal
that we will see from the above improvements is enough to make this
irrelevant.)

* Friday 7th
** N2 Photoionisation
*** 11:50 Laser optimisation					 :Log:
The laser is now being seen to by a technician to try and get it up to
its original power (~4 mJ/pulse). This should give us a much bigger
signal; since we have a three-photon process the efficiency scales
with E^3.
*** 11:17 Spectrum data 					       :Data:
I've cleaned up the spectra taken shown in the entry of the 31st of
May. The image below shows the relevant data ([[file:../05/N2PI/29-05-13/][data set]] [[file:N2PI/scripts/N2PI_plot1.py][python script]]): 

#+CAPTION: Figure 1. 
#+CAPTION: Spectrum of N2 photoionisation, and power of the laser
#+CAPTION: as the scan was being taken. 
#+LABEL: fig:N2-PI-spectrum
[[file:img/N2PI_spec.png][file:img/N2PI_spec.png]]

The main difference here is that I have taken away another junk scan
that had slipped in, and excluded all count-rate data for which the
power on the meter was less than 10 units (on the scale in the
plots). This cutoff was necessary because it was distorting spectra
significantly as can be seen at the end of the first iteration of the
diagram. 

Using the paper ([[file:2013/06/img/n2pi.pdf][N2PI]]) as a guide, we have been able to positively
identify lines from the /P/, /Q/ and /R/ branch and can speculate that
the line that is not shown in the paper (out of scan range) is from
the /O/ branch. The terminology in the paper however is fairly tricky,
and I'm not sure we've figured out a correct interpretation yet. It's
essential that we know exactly what lines we are looking at however,
so I have been trying to investigate.

*** 14:00 Comparison with paper, and terminology 		   :Analysis:
It seems that the convention is that the symbols represent change in
/total/ angular momentum including the angular momentum of the
electron: 

K = \Lambda_{electron} + N_{rot}

In this case we would expect that the /R_0/ line represents the `bare'
electronic transition frequency, with no adjustments for rotational
energy: 

N_{X} = 0, \\
\Delta K = +1, \\
\Delta \Lambda = +1, \\
\to N_{a} = 0.

Where /X/ and /a/ subscripts refer to the ground and excited states
respectively. The additional rotational energy of these states is
given by:

#+LABEL: eqn:rotational-splitting
\Delta E_i = B_i \cdot N(N+1), [eqn.1]\\
(i = X, a)

Given these relations we would expect that the spacing of the lines in
the R-branch (/R_0/, /R_1/, /R_2/ etc.), would increase quadratically in
accordance with the difference of the rotational constants /B_X/ and
/B_a/. We also expect that the rotational constant for the excited state
should be smaller than that of the ground state, given that the
wavefunction is more spread out and therefore has a larger moment of
inertia. This should give lines with quadratic spacing, succesively
reducing in energy (or increasing in wavelength).

The characteristic of the R-branch in the paper, however, is not like
this. Instead the energy spacing first increases, before reaching a
turning point between /R_2/ and /R_3/ and then going on to decrease
quadratically. By similar arguments to the above, this is the
characteristic of a branch of transitions where the rotational number
increases by 1 (which, in this terminology and for this transition
would be an S-branch). 

The paper's Q-branch in fact behaves in the way we would expect the
R-branch to behave, or as a Q-branch would behave for an excited state
with no electron angular momentum. It doesn't seem likely that the
notation is wrong however, since the fact that /Q/ subscripts start at 1
and /P/ subscripts start at 2 are another indication of correct
interpretation of the terminology. 

*** 16:13 Fitting						   :Analysis:
Taking a heuristic approach, we fit the data to a model that takes
into account rotational splittings of the two levels according to
equation 1 (\ref{eqn:rotational-splitting}). We can then start with
either assumption that R-branch or the Q-branch is the /\Delta N = 0/
transition, and see which model fits best.

- /Follows an explanation of fitting using the Q-branch (short answer:
  it didn't work):/ 

Assuming the Q-branch is /\Delta N = 0/, and taking the literature value
of the ground state rotational constant (~1.9) we find an excited
state rotational constant of ~1.75. Since the Q-branch in the paper
only starts at 1 we can either assume that /Q_{0}/ is disallowed and
extrapolate where it would be, or that /Q_{1}/ is the fundamental
transition. Either way we can fit the Q-branch easily to the paper,
but then using the calculated value of /B_{a}/, we get no agreement with
any of the other lines in the paper or our spectrum.

- /And using the R-branch (short answer: it kind-of works):/

#+CAPTION: Figure 2.
#+CAPTION: Fit to the N_2 photionisation data for low values of /K (K < 3)/.
#+CAPTION: Higher values give a bad fit. The stars represent observed spectral lines. 
#+LABEL: fig:low-k-fit
[[file:img/low_k_fit.png][file:img/low_k_fit.png]]

Using the /R_0/ line as the fundamental electronic transition, we can
calculate /B_X/ from the energy difference:

\Delta E = E(R_0) - E(Q_1) \\
\Delta E = 2B_X.

This gives us a value of /B_X/ of ~0.9, which disagrees with the
literature value fairly significantly (approx. a factor of
2). Regardless this fits the paper data well for the lines that we
have that are only determined by /R_0/ and /B_X/ (/R_0/, /Q_1/ and
/P_2/).

Similarly, we can calculate a value of /B_a/ from the energy
difference of the /S_0/ and /R_0/ branches. This gives us a value of
/B_a/ of ~1.9, which clearly goes against the expectation that /B_a <
B_X/. Again disregarding the discrepancy, we find that we get a good
fit to the /S_0/ line (dependent only on /B_a/), and additionally
it gives us a good fit for lines ending in /K=2/ of the upper
state. Beyond this both the characteristic and the fit is far off.

This fit is shown in Fig. 2 (\ref{fig:low-k-fit}) ([[file:scripts/PISpectrum.m][matlab
script]]). There are several fitted lines that match the data, and their
allocations also match those of the paper. The lines that have no
corresponding data-points do have corresponding lines or allocations
in the paper. The data points that don't have corresponding lines have
corresponding allocations in the paper, and come from transitions to
the excited state with /K>2/.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

   "cavity-QED".
2. Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
3. Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and

** Hanle dip experiment parameters
The file used in the simulation only has what has been derived from
the stats Kevin gave me - here are the full set of parameters:

N.B. The x-axis is defined as the trap axis. The y-axis is
perpendicular to this in the horizontal plane. The z-axis is the
vertical axis. $\alpha$ is defined as the angle from the x-axis in the
horizontal plane, $\beta$ as the angle away from the horizontal plane. 

*** Lasers
The first two are the main lasers, and to start with I have not
included the third in the simulation. The main purpose of it is for
radial cooling, and because of its low power and large size, I'm
hoping it won't make a big difference.

| wavelength /nm | detuning /MHz | Power /uW | beam diameter /um | \alpha /deg | \beta /deg | polarisation |
|----------------+---------------+-----------+-------------------+-------------+------------+--------------|
|            397 |           -30 |         5 |                28 |           0 |          0 | \sigma_{+}   |
|            866 |             0 |      1000 |               145 |         180 |          0 | Y            |
|            397 |           -30 |         1 |                60 |          85 |          0 | X            |

*** B-field
These are only approximate. I think the y coils actually have
different dimensions/separations from the other two, which is why I've
made a table that I can fill in appropriately when I have the values. 
The coils each have $N=100$ turns.

| axis | separation /mm | diameter /mm | current /mA |
|------+----------------+--------------+-------------|
| x    |            140 |          115 |       106.9 |
| y    |            140 |          115 |           0 |
| z    |            140 |          115 |        16.3 |
