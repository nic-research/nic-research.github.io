<p>I couldn't go ahead with the scans yesterday because the N2 canister
was empty. I don't know how it was emptied, but perhaps its due to one
of the many connections it has being leaky. Before the experiment I
will re-attach the output so that it is only going to the PI
experiment. 
</p>
<p>
Further, while I was waiting, I have set up the autotracker and found
that it can scan the full range that we are expecting to see lines
over (473.95 nm &rarr; 474.30 nm) without significantly changing power.
</p>
<p>
Mike Hardiman says he's looking about for a pre-amplifier that he used
to use for the same channeltrons, and that should help us to get rid
of discriminator drift. If that's not here by tomorrow morning I will
go ahead and make a scan anyway.

<p>The laser has been attended by a technician and is running at
approximately the same power as during the last scans. At around
T(q-switch) = (150 &rarr; 180) us, the pulse energy of the laser is (1.3
&rarr; 1.5) mJ. The beam-profile looks marginally better. I am told that
we have ordered replacement prisms (used to separate the fundamental
from the frequency doubled light), which should increase the output
power to around 2.5 mJ. As mentioned previously, since the
photoionisation is a third-order process, the gains from these
improvements should be substantial. 
</p>
<p>
I'm going to try taking scans with the current setup. Again ignoring
the auto-tracker and instead adjusting the doubling-crystal angle
manually approximately every 0.05 nm.
</p>
<p>
(N.B. It seemed to me, from the behaviour of previous scans, that we
could do with improving the stability of the channeltron output signal
by adding a preamplifier before the discriminator, but I'm going to
hold off on that for the moment just in case the increase in signal
that we will see from the above improvements is enough to make this
irrelevant.)

<p>The laser is now being seen to by a technician to try and get it up to
its original power (~4 mJ/pulse). This should give us a much bigger
signal; since we have a three-photon process the efficiency scales
with E<sup>3</sup>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">

<p>I've cleaned up the spectra taken shown in the entry of the 31st of
May. The image below shows the relevant data:
</p>

<div id="fig-N2-PI-spectrum" class="figure">
<p><img src="img/N2PI_spec.png"  alt="img/N2PI_spec.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. Spectrum of N2 photoionisation, and power of the laser as the scan was being taken.</p>
</div>

<p>
The main difference here is that I have taken away another junk scan
that had slipped in, and excluded all count-rate data for which the
power on the meter was less than 10 units (on the scale in the
plots). This cutoff was necessary because it was distorting spectra
significantly as can be seen at the end of the first iteration of the
diagram. 
</p>
<p>
Using the paper (<a href="2013/06/img/n2pi.pdf">N2PI</a>) as a guide, we have been able to positively
identify lines from the <i>P</i>, <i>Q</i> and <i>R</i> branch and can speculate that
the line that is not shown in the paper (out of scan range) is from
the <i>O</i> branch. The terminology in the paper however is fairly tricky,
and I'm not sure we've figured out a correct interpretation yet. It's
essential that we know exactly what lines we are looking at however,
so I have been trying to investigate.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="sec-3-1-3">14:00 Comparison with paper, and terminology &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tag"><span class="Analysis">Analysis</span></span></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-3">

<p>It seems that the convention is that the symbols represent change in
<i>total</i> angular momentum including the angular momentum of the
electron: 
</p>
<p>
K = &Lambda;<sub>electron</sub> + N<sub>rot</sub>
</p>
<p>
In this case we would expect that the <i>R<sub>0</sub></i> line represents the `bare'
electronic transition frequency, with no adjustments for rotational
energy: 
</p>
<p>
N<sub>X</sub> = 0, <br/>
&Delta; K = +1, <br/>
&Delta; &Lambda; = +1, <br/>
&rarr; N<sub>a</sub> = 0.
</p>
<p>
Where <i>X</i> and <i>a</i> subscripts refer to the ground and excited states
respectively. The additional rotational energy of these states is
given by:
</p>
<p>
&Delta; E<sub>i</sub> = B<sub>i</sub> &sdot; N(N+1), [eqn.1]<br/>
(i = X, a)
</p>
<p>
Given these relations we would expect that the spacing of the lines in
the R-branch (<i>R<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> etc.), would increase quadratically in
accordance with the difference of the rotational constants <i>B<sub>X</sub></i> and
<i>B<sub>a</sub></i>. We also expect that the rotational constant for the excited state
should be smaller than that of the ground state, given that the
wavefunction is more spread out and therefore has a larger moment of
inertia. This should give lines with quadratic spacing, succesively
reducing in energy (or increasing in wavelength).
</p>
<p>
The characteristic of the R-branch in the paper, however, is not like
this. Instead the energy spacing first increases, before reaching a
turning point between <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>R<sub>3</sub></i> and then going on to decrease
quadratically. By similar arguments to the above, this is the
characteristic of a branch of transitions where the rotational number
increases by 1 (which, in this terminology and for this transition
would be an S-branch). 
</p>
<p>
The paper's Q-branch in fact behaves in the way we would expect the
R-branch to behave, or as a Q-branch would behave for an excited state
with no electron angular momentum. It doesn't seem likely that the
notation is wrong however, since the fact that <i>Q</i> subscripts start at 1
and <i>P</i> subscripts start at 2 are another indication of correct
interpretation of the terminology.

<h4 id="sec-3-1-4">16:13 Fitting &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tag"><span class="Analysis">Analysis</span></span></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-4">

<p>Taking a heuristic approach, we fit the data to a model that takes
into account rotational splittings of the two levels according to
equation 1 (<a href="#eqn-rotational-splitting">rotational-splitting</a>). We can then start with
either assumption that R-branch or the Q-branch is the <i>&Delta; N = 0</i>
transition, and see which model fits best.
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Follows an explanation of fitting using the Q-branch (short answer:   it didn't work):</i> 
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Assuming the Q-branch is <i>&Delta; N = 0</i>, and taking the literature value
of the ground state rotational constant (~1.9) we find an excited
state rotational constant of ~1.75. Since the Q-branch in the paper
only starts at 1 we can either assume that <i>Q<sub>0</sub></i> is disallowed and
extrapolate where it would be, or that <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> is the fundamental
transition. Either way we can fit the Q-branch easily to the paper,
but then using the calculated value of <i>B<sub>a</sub></i>, we get no agreement with
any of the other lines in the paper or our spectrum.
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>And using the R-branch (short answer: it kind-of works):</i>
</li>
</ul>



<div id="fig-low-k-fit" class="figure">
<p><img src="img/low_k_fit.png"  alt="img/low_k_fit.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 2. Fit to the N<sub>2</sub> photionisation data for low values of <i>K (K &lt; 3)</i>. Higher values give a bad fit. The stars represent observed spectral lines.</p>
</div>

<p>
Using the <i>R<sub>0</sub></i> line as the fundamental electronic transition, we can
calculate <i>B<sub>X</sub></i> from the energy difference:
</p>
<p>
&Delta; E = E(R<sub>0</sub>) - E(Q<sub>1</sub>) <br/>
&Delta; E = 2B<sub>X</sub>.
</p>
<p>
This gives us a value of <i>B<sub>X</sub></i> of ~0.9, which disagrees with the
literature value fairly significantly (approx. a factor of
2). Regardless this fits the paper data well for the lines that we
have that are only determined by <i>R<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>X</sub></i> (<i>R<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i>).
</p>
<p>
Similarly, we can calculate a value of <i>B<sub>a</sub></i> from the energy
difference of the <i>S<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>R<sub>0</sub></i> branches. This gives us a value of
<i>B<sub>a</sub></i> of ~1.9, which clearly goes against the expectation that <i>B<sub>a</sub> &lt; B<sub>X</sub></i>. Again disregarding the discrepancy, we find that we get a good
fit to the <i>S<sub>0</sub></i> line (dependent only on <i>B<sub>a</sub></i>), and additionally
it gives us a good fit for lines ending in <i>K=2</i> of the upper
state. Beyond this both the characteristic and the fit is far off.
</p>
<p>
This fit is shown in Fig. 2 (<a href="#fig-low-k-fit">low-k-fit</a>). There are several
fitted lines that match the data, and their allocations also match
those of the paper. The lines that have no corresponding data-points
do have corresponding lines or allocations in the paper. The data
points that don't have corresponding lines have corresponding
allocations in the paper, and come from transitions to the excited
state with <i>K&gt;2</i>.

<p>Jack has had to move on to fibre shooting after some trouble with
getting a spectrum around the gnd-state transition. I'm going to take
over generally, once Matthias has reoptimised the laser and finished
baking the chamber (having just replaced the channeltron).

<p>I managed to get a full spectrum on Wednesday and analyse it today. I
think we've got the whole series of lines, and I've handed it over to
Matthias to see if he can identify the ground state transition from
it.

<p>Depending on interpretation of the paper we're using (<a href="2013/06/img/n2pi.pdf">N2PI</a>), we either
have the lines we need or they are a little further to the low energy
end of the scale than we currently have. Need help interpreting paper,
and will take another longer scan just in case, once the laser is
optimised.

<p>Does the oscillation have something to do with a kind of `parametric'
excitation from the laser pressure - Perhaps the ion only feels force
from the laser when it is at the edges of its oscillation (no Doppler
shift).

<p>Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?

<p>This question is not important if the `phonon-laser'-like approach
we're going to try and take works well. This idea is on hold until
more work is done there.

<p>I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page
of the site (extended abstract?).
</p>
<p>  
Furthermore, I think it'd be nice to look over the diagrams that are
on there already, and think about whether or not I could make some
improved ones in POVRAY.

<p>Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:
</p>
<p>
"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.
</p>
<p>
By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."
</p>
<p>
Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(<a href="http://www.microchip.com/">http://www.microchip.com/</a>). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

</li>
<li>There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
</li>
<li>Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
</li>
<li>Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?
</li>
