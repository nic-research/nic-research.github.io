** Heat engine: Next steps 					       :logs:
The meeting has highlighted the important points to tackle with this
simulation.

First and most obvious is that the dipole force is x1000 too weak in
my simulation. The approach to this problem will be to show Hiroki the
code and see if he can spot the error, as I have not been able to up
until now.

Next, my simulations don't show a strong dependence of the amplitude
of the motion on the detuning. The experiment shows that as detuning
decreases, the amplitude of motion increases. I think that this might
be an issue with the fact that I have only been changing the frequency
on a relatively small scale. Considering that experimental data was
taken with the wavemeter lock, it's possible that the detuning was
much larger to start with than my -0.5 \Gamma. Therefore I should try
larger detunings.

Last major issue is that I haven't looked in depth at the amplitude
dependence on power of the laser. This should be fairly easy to
do alongside plots of the dependence on detuning and position of the
beam.

** Heat engine: Some success 					       :logs:
As decided in the notes of the 5th of September, and suggested by
Matthias, I have added a second dimension to the heat engine
simulation. It was Matthias' opinion that there should be no
oscillation without the second dimension, and indeed I could not find
any self-starting oscillation under reasonable circumstances.

After adding the second dimension and playing around with parameters,
I did find that we get a self-starting oscillation of comparable
amplitude to what we see in the experiment. The big caveat is that in
order to see it, I had to artificially `amplify' the magnitude of the
dipole force by x1000. I've had Matthias look over the code and he
can't see an error in my calculation of the dipole force, so the
source of this discrepancy is thus far a mystery. I think it might be
helpful to get precise laser parameters for the experiment, in case
this helps due to the different scaling of dipole force and radiation
heating with the intensity and laser focus.

** Heat engine: Properties 					       :logs:
One set of parameters for the heat-engine effect are at the following
link: [[file:test_params_XY.m][test_params_XY.m]]. These values are taken from those approximate
values recorded by Kevin while observing the heat-engine effect.

The relevant parameters for one test case are:

#+BEGIN_SRC MATLAB
% Axes and Angles:   
% x = trap axis       (endcap-endcap)
% y = cavity axis     (horizontal and perp. to x)
% z = vertical axis   (up direction)

% Trap frequency [trap-axis; y-direction] 
omega = [240e3*2*pi; 1E6*2*pi]; 

% Laser direction
alpha = 85*deg;   % angle with trap axis in horizontal plane
beta  = 0*deg;    % angle out of horizontal plane

% Laser powers and spot sizes (SI)
P_1 = 1E-4;
waist1_0 = 50E-6;

P_3 = 0; % Incoherent pumping used instead! (simulate 2-stage repumping)
waist3_0 = 145E-6;

%Position of focus of lasers on the trap axis (x)
waist1_x = waist1_0/sin(alpha);
waist1_y = waist1_0/cos(alpha);
x_0 = -waist1_x*(4/4);  

% Laser detunings (units of Gamma)
Delta1 = -0.5;
Delta3 = +10;

% incoherent pumping 
GammaPump1 = 0;
GammaPump3 = 0.53;
#+END_SRC

This generates an oscillation, from standing, of order 100 um after
around 1 ms. It should be noted that because the script must calculate
the density matrix twice per loop (for two different positions to give
the dipole-energy gradient), it is quite slow - every ms simulated
takes approximately 10 minutes.

The position of the focus of the laser in the above case is at the
point of largest dipole force. When the laser is pointed more directly
at the ion for a weaker force, the coherent oscillation diminishes, as
expected and as confirmed by Kevin experimentally. However, in both
cases there appears to be /some/ oscillation in both x and y
directions, but with very small amplitude (probably undetectable in
the experiment). 

As the detuning is decreased from \Delta = -0.5 \Gamma to \Delta =
0, the amplitude of coherent x-motion does not appear to change
drastically. The time before the oscillation starts however, appears
to be slightly longer for smaller detuning. I need to check with Kevin
whether or not this is consistent with the experiment, as I was under
the impression that the oscillation was somehow `improved' with
smaller detuning.

** Heat-engine y-temperature
Matthias' explanation of the heat engine (as far as I understand it):

1. A near-saturated ion is cooled by the laser beam and localised at a
   point of high dipole force.

2. The dipole force pushes the ion towards the higher-intensity region
   of the laser beam, causing further saturation and less efficient
   cooling. 

3. The ion subsequently heats in the x and y directions, reducing the
   average amplitude of the dipole force (that is the bit that I'm not
   so sure is correct or clear).

4. With a smaller dipole force on the ion, it moves back towards the
   equilibrium position where the intensity is lower and the ion is
   cooled again. From here the cycle repeats.

Given this explanation, if we can calculate the temperature of the ion
over time, it should oscillate with the frequency of the coherent
motion. This is easiest to do in the y-direction, since we don't
expect that there is such a large oscillation in that direction, and
can take all motion contribution to temperature.

Sure enough, if we take the temperature over time we can see an
oscillation at the frequency of the x-motion. It is not clearly
visible by eye, but with an FFT we see sidebands on the coherent
y-motion at the \omega_x. Also, as the detuning is decreased from -0.5
\Gamma to 0, we see the y-oscillation and the sidebands grow, and
eventually we see a peak at the fundamental frequency \omega_x, rise
out of the noise.

I'll be talking to Matthias about further analysis in the meeting
tomorrow, hopefully.

** General simulations rewrite					       :logs:
As per the plan (only entry in August), I have cleaned up all my
Matlab simulations for spectra and molecular dynamics. Simulations
that use the quantum optics toolbox now all use external scripts to
compose the various components of the Liouvillian that are
relevant. Putting together the final Liouvillian is left in the main
body of code, as is any actual MD or simple-harmonic motion
simulations, since that is the real meat of any of these codes. 

The old molecular dynamics codes have been cleaned up and
redundant/obsolete versions moved into labelled folders. Also, most
simulations have been separated into scripts labelled with either
"_MD" or "_SHO", which denote whether the mechanics are regular
newtonian molecular dynamics or simple-harmonic oscillator,
respectively. 

** Inconsistency in Heat Engine simulation solved, still no oscillation :logs:
At some point I probably wrote a log stating that there was an
inconsistency in the population of the excited state during my
heat-engine simulation when compared with my simple spectroscopy
simulation. I found the inconsistency was in how I calculated the Rabi
frequency of the repumper laser. This has now been fixed across all
simulations, and results are consistent. 

This has allowed me to use the spectroscopy simulation to pick good
parameters for the heat-engine simulation, and determine that there is
indeed very little, or no, contribution to the ion motion coming from
the dipole force in the 1D regime. 

The next step is to add a second dimension to the simulation, which
shouldn't be too difficult, but might have to be done over the next
week at the conference.

Amy has e-mailed me the automation programs for loading Ca+,
N2+ and for crystal cleaning. Need to work those into my automation vi.
*** DONE Fast autocorrelation calculation
- <2013-09-23 Mon>
Had this done a while back, don't know why this entry hadn't been
updated. will look for an entry on it and refer there, or if not
found, write a new one.
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
[X] Try using CUDA for a fast autocorrelation calculation 
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
Maybe first just try using Wolfgang's code. It might just be fast
enough on its own.
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Hiroki has refactored Wolfgang's code into sub-functions and I'm now
using his DLL. I tried running a few tests with python but it's really
way too slow for large datasets.
- <2013-08-28 Wed>
I've managed to make this work for a test data set in ascii using my
own dll extracted from Wolfgang and Hiroki's code. It should speed up
once I make it use binary data.
*** CNCL Describe phonon laser trick in notes

Only really required if it turns out to be usable. Waiting on Kevin's
results. 
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Not needed until the paper is written.
** TODO [#C] Simulations						:Nic:
*** HOLD [#C] Single ion `heat-engine' effect
- <2013-09-23 Mon>
After refactoring we see the oscillation, but it's difficult to get a
handle on the exact cause (and to confirm it's what Matthias says it
is). I've programmed tools for analysis that someone else can look at
after I've left. Automation of the molecule experiment is more
important right now.
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Does the oscillation have something to do with a kind of `parametric'
excitation from the laser pressure - Perhaps the ion only feels force
from the laser when it is at the edges of its oscillation (no Doppler
shift).
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Still working on this, but got the dipole force nearly in
properly. Need to compare ways of calculating dipole force to make
sure they agree. If we don't see the effect with a 1D model, then
maybe we need to think about a 3D model (which Matthias reckons is the
only model that should fit). 
- <2013-08-30 Fri>
Matthias and I have agreed that I should refactor this general
simulation code so that it is clean and legible, then hand it over to
one of the students before I go. We've decided this should be Will. I
will find the time to do this, probably after handing over the
automation software to Amy.
- <2013-09-05 Thu>
Code has been refactored and cleaned up along with the rest. Time to
add a second dimension the simulation and see if that gives us the
effect we see in the trap.

*** HOLD [#B] Hanle dip/b-field map simulation
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Waiting on Kevin to make some measurements to see if they match my
simulations. 
**** HOLD [#C] Fluorescence as a function of B-field for different light pol.
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Done for now, need to talk about Matthias about results seen.
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Need to find a way of combining maps from different polarisations and
directions to give independent B-field direction data.
*** CNCL [#C] One or two calcium ions
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?
- <2013-05-28 Tue>
This question is not important if the `phonon-laser'-like approach
we're going to try and take works well. This idea is on hold until
more work is done there.
- <2013-09-05 Thu>
Not going to be time for this, and probably not neccessary.
