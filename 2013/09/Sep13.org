* Thursday 5th
** General simulations rewrite					       :logs:
As per the plan (only entry in August), I have cleaned up all my
Matlab simulations for spectra and molecular dynamics. Simulations
that use the quantum optics toolbox now all use external scripts to
compose the various components of the Liouvillian that are
relevant. Putting together the final Liouvillian is left in the main
body of code, as is any actual MD or simple-harmonic motion
simulations, since that is the real meat of any of these codes. 

The old molecular dynamics codes have been cleaned up and
redundant/obsolete versions moved into labelled folders. Also, most
simulations have been separated into scripts labelled with either
"_MD" or "_SHO", which denote whether the mechanics are regular
newtonian molecular dynamics or simple-harmonic oscillator,
respectively. 

** Inconsistency in Heat Engine simulation solved, still no oscillation :logs:
At some point I probably wrote a log stating that there was an
inconsistency in the population of the excited state during my
heat-engine simulation when compared with my simple spectroscopy
simulation. I found the inconsistency was in how I calculated the Rabi
frequency of the repumper laser. This has now been fixed across all
simulations, and results are consistent. 

This has allowed me to use the spectroscopy simulation to pick good
parameters for the heat-engine simulation, and determine that there is
indeed very little, or no, contribution to the ion motion coming from
the dipole force in the 1D regime. 

The next step is to add a second dimension to the simulation, which
shouldn't be too difficult, but might have to be done over the next
week at the conference.

* To do: Molecule lab 
** TODO Interferometer							:Nic:
*** TODO Re-optimise around trap
*** TODO Check chromatic abberation
** TODO Photoionisation of N2					    :Nic:Amy:
*** TODO Explain photoionisation process
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Draw up diagram with our options, write-up including selection rules
(see Matthias).
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Some notes are in my logbook - need to write those up.
*** DONE Replace damaged optical elements in laser
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Waiting on parts
- <2013-08-06 Tue>
Parts arrived last week. They will be replaced next time the dye is
changed. This is more or less handed over to Amy however.
*** TODO Re-take spectra with better S-N
** TODO [#B] Code an automation program for experiments		  :Nic:Kevin:
*** TODO [#A] Fast autocorrelation calculation
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
[X] Try using CUDA for a fast autocorrelation calculation 
- <2013-04-09 Tue>
Maybe first just try using Wolfgang's code. It might just be fast
enough on its own.
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Hiroki has refactored Wolfgang's code into sub-functions and I'm now
using his DLL. I tried running a few tests with python but it's really
way too slow for large datasets.
- <2013-08-28 Wed>
I've managed to make this work for a test data set in ascii using my
own dll extracted from Wolfgang and Hiroki's code. It should speed up
once I make it use binary data.
*** CNCL Describe phonon laser trick in notes
- <2013-05-15 Wed>
Check if I already have.
- <2013-06-10 Mon>
Only really required if it turns out to be usable. Waiting on Kevin's
results. 
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Not needed until the paper is written.
** TODO [#C] Simulations						:Nic:
*** TODO [#B] Single ion `heat-engine' effect
- <2013-05-30 Thu>
Does the oscillation have something to do with a kind of `parametric'
excitation from the laser pressure - Perhaps the ion only feels force
from the laser when it is at the edges of its oscillation (no Doppler
shift).
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Still working on this, but got the dipole force nearly in
properly. Need to compare ways of calculating dipole force to make
sure they agree. If we don't see the effect with a 1D model, then
maybe we need to think about a 3D model (which Matthias reckons is the
only model that should fit). 
- <2013-08-30 Fri>
Matthias and I have agreed that I should refactor this general
simulation code so that it is clean and legible, then hand it over to
one of the students before I go. We've decided this should be Will. I
will find the time to do this, probably after handing over the
automation software to Amy.
- <2013-09-05 Thu>
Code has been refactored and cleaned up along with the rest. Time to
add a second dimension the simulation and see if that gives us the
effect we see in the trap.

*** HOLD [#B] Hanle dip/b-field map simulation
- <2013-07-31 Wed>
Waiting on Kevin to make some measurements to see if they match my
simulations. 
**** HOLD [#C] Fluorescence as a function of B-field for different light pol.
- <2013-06-21 Fri>
Done for now, need to talk about Matthias about results seen.
- <2013-07-01 Mon>
Need to find a way of combining maps from different polarisations and
directions to give independent B-field direction data.
*** CNCL [#C] One or two calcium ions
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?
- <2013-05-28 Tue>
This question is not important if the `phonon-laser'-like approach
we're going to try and take works well. This idea is on hold until
more work is done there.
- <2013-09-05 Thu>
Not going to be time for this, and probably not neccessary.

Not working nicely, haven't figured out how to render a good image
yet, let alone ways to use absorptive media to represent the negative
wavefunction.

*** Lighting rigs and pulse generators
Can the pulse generator Matthias designed be used for programming
lighting rigs? Ask Gaz.
