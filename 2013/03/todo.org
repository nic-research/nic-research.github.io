* To do, Molecular Lab Experiments

** DONE Beam-line preparation					  :Nic:Kevin:
*** CNCL Second TMP installation
- <2012-12-04 Tue>
Data in previous headline indicates there's not enough pumping power
and the ion trap region in the beamline chamber. It's time to consider
adding a turbo to pump alongside the ion pump to maintain a good
pressure differential between the beamline and the trapping region. 
- <2013-01-03 Thu>
Matthias has ordered the parts, but we are trying a setup that may not
require them first (see entry on preliminary N2 chamber)
- <2013-02-18 Mon>
We're going ahead without this, just using a prechamber as described
in January's notes.

*** DONE Take apart beamline
- <2013-02-13 Wed> Alan needs the 5-way cross
- <2013-02-18 Mon> Alan now has the second skimmer built, and I've
  taken the 5-way cross out for him and handed it over.
*** DONE Check for all the parts
- <2013-02-18 Mon>
Need 6 CF60 (?) gasketts and an adapter from CF60 to DN63.
*** Hand over the rest to Kevin
** TODO [#A] Dipole force laser setup					:Nic:
*** DONE AM setup
*** DONE New laser
- <2013-02-18 Mon>
Set up and lasing at correct wavelength. Power is lower than the 100 mW
it is rated at with an external cavity, but we are not exactly at the
emission peak of the bare diode (took a lot of tuning away from the
place with easiest optical feedback). Further, the bare diode is rated
at 200 mA, but I'm not sure how high I can run it with an external
cavity. 
 
λ = 787.475 nm,

I_{th} ~ 45 mA,

T = 25.36^{\circ} C,

I = 77.54 mA,

V_{PZT} = 107 V,

P ~ 10 mW, 

*** DONE [#A] Single-pass AOM and optical fibre
- <2013-02-21 Thu> Set up on the test table.
*** TODO Inteferometer/feedback setup
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Find appropriate PZT for second arm of the interferometer (small
travel, high stability)

** DONE Time-varying B-field ion simulation			  :Nic:Kevin:
*** DONE Matthias' code
- <2013-02-13 Wed> Compare Matthias' approach with my own
- <2013-02-20 Wed> Virtually identical apart from the solver, which is
  the correct, time-dependent approach.
*** DONE Modifications
- <2013-02-20 Wed> Frequencies around Γ show a dropoff, but that's
  much higher than what we see. Need new ideas as to the source of the
  attenuation. 
** TODO [#C] Work on DACs for the new SCL			  :Nic:Kevin:
*** TODO Building boards
- <2013-01-25 Fri> Matthias has the plans:
Pester him for them.
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Received:
Matthias sent them ages ago, but I didn't spot them in my mail. He's
still yet to order the actual DACs though, so there's still time. I
could make the boards however, in preparation.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Matthias is making the boards:
Matthias is making the boards, I think it'll just be up to me to
program the whole thing.
- <2013-02-04 Mon> Pins used:
Check with Matthias that his design has incorporated these pins as
I/Os:
+ Port D: RD8 (peak detect input), RD5 (CN_interrupt)
+ U2RX pins, unless he's already designed these away
*** TODO Programming
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with computer
**** TODO Write SPI library for PIC comms with DAC

** TODO [#B] Code an automation program for experiments		  :Nic:Kevin:
*** TODO Contact FAST ComTec
About the issue with having to communicate with the card via the
server. 

*** TODO Fix datasocket bug
*** TODO Flow chart for experimental sequence
** CNCL Look up literature for PI of N2				    :Amy:Nic:
- Wavelength and I_{sat}
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Matthias and Jack seem to be under the impression that the problem is
down to the power in the dye laser. This in turn is likely to be a
problem with the power from the pump laser, which Chris Rennick from
Oxford had a look at. He says that it needs some regular maintanence,
and probably a new flashbulb. An engineer has been called and a visit
will be arranged soon by Jack.

** TODO [#B] Simulations						:Nic:
*** TODO One or two calcium ions
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Although an extra ion will reduce the acceleration of the crystal due
to the dipole force, is the increase in signal a good trade-off?
*** TODO Adiabatic switching on/off of the cooling laser
- <2013-03-22 Fri>
Optimal parameters for adiabatic switching in order to avoid `kicking'
the ions when switching between cooling and optical-dipole force and
amplification periods. What is the typically used function?


* To do, General

** DONE "Gantt Project" for project planning
- <2013-02-15 Fri> Installed.
** DONE Fix up Stephen's Toptica PID
- <2013-02-13 Wed> More unstable that I remember, tune up.
- <2013-02-18 Mon> I gave a go to tuning it up but no luck. Might need
  a closer look, but will ask Matthias to have a gander first.
- <2013-03-25 Mon> Matthias had a look and fixed it up before I went
  away to Mexico. Rather than just looking at the electronics, he
  tuned up the doubling cavity too. This improved the stability
  significantly, from what I hear.
** DONE Fix Laura's pulsed-trapping box
- <2013-03-25 Mon> 
Somebody must have done this while I was away. Laura managed to get
the square-wave trapping to work before she left.
** TODO [#C] Check for tantalum for ovens
** CNCL Look into programming Laura's multiscaler for mass detection
- <2013-03-25 Mon>
Laura's left with her trap, back to Oxford. They're first going to
look into ion identification using MCPs and the square-wave trapping.

** Find submissions for ITCM-Sussex.com
- <2012-11-13 Tue>
Matthias has reminded us to look through the old website for these.

- <2012-11-20 Tue> 
I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page
of the site (extended abstract?).
  
Furthermore, I think it'd be nice to look over the diagrams that are
on there already, and think about whether or not I could make some
improved ones in POVRAY.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

- <2013-01-04 Fri> Comments on current webpage:
1. There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
2. Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
3. Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?

** Ask Hiroki for a look at the code for cavity mode prop.
- <2012-11-06 Tue>  
Asked Hiroki, but he hasn't finished it yet. 

** Oxford group proposal research
- <2012-12-05 Wed>
  * Drewsen group BBR assisted cooling
  * Previous ammonia research
  * Ammonia level structure for state-detection
- <2012-12-10 Mon>
  * Drewsen and Schiller both have papers on BBR according to the proposal.
  * Drewsen proposal uses Raman transitions, requiring narrow/stable
    lasers - does this apply to our system?
- <2012-12-17 Mon>
E-mail Brianna to assess the status of the Stark decelerator.
- <2013-01-03 Thu> General:
Look closer at the reactions that are proposed to investigate in the
proposal, and make sure that there are going to be setups for those
experiments, or ones to do with our research here, at Oxford.

- Reactions -> Deuterium fractionation:
Reactions involving H atom transfer to ionic species e.g.:
: Ca^+ + HD0 -> CaH^+(CaD^+) + OD(H)
: Nd_3^+ + HDO -> ND_4^+(ND_3H^+) + OH(OD)

Addition reactions with H atom elimination (e.g. in [[file:~/Documents/literature/proposals/ProjectDescription.pdf][proposal]]), and
Near-thermoneutral charge transfer reactions (e.g. at link).

- Experimental:
In-situ measurement of masses and numbers of reactants and
products -> Monitor sequential isotopic exchange.

Quantum-state selected reactants from stark decelerator (neutrals) and
REMPI (ions). Thermal redistribution of ions monitored by
non-destructive state-detection.

Control internal states using BBR assisted schemes (see [[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/nphys1604.pdf][nphys1604]] and
[[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/nphys1605.pdf][nphys1605]]).
