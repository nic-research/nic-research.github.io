<p>Yesterday's discussions during and after the meeting have cleared up
some of the ideas surrounding the pulse sequence for application of
the dipole force. 
</p>
<p>
The initial problem that was brought up is that we must turn off the
cooling laser (or switch it to blue) before applying the dipole force
in order not to damp it out with cooling power, but this must be done
without inducing a `kick' from changes in light pressure. Any induced
kick may act as a false positive for our dipole force detection.
</p>
<p>
One proposed solution is to switch directly to blue (amplification
stage) at the exact same level of radiation pressure, but this
requires much better wavelength stabilisation than can be provided by
the wavemetere. Further we cannot prioritise building a doubling
cavity for the cooling laser and resurrecting the SCL, if we can think
of another way around this problem&hellip;
</p>
<p>
&hellip; Which is to use adiabatic switching of the laser beam. In
principle, if we switch the laser slowly and smoothly enough we should
be able to turn it off and back on again without inducing any kick to
the secular motion of the ion. The idea in practice is to program an
SRS function generator with a pulse window of the correct shape and to
have that pulse window triggered to be in synch with the dipole force
and red/blue cooling laser switching. 
</p>
<p>
The optimal shape for the window can be determined from its FFT and
its corresponding amplitude at the secular frequency of the ion. If we
can work out how large we estimate the dipole force to be, we can set
a limit on the amplitude of the window pulse to be some large factor
below that. Further, we can look at the amount of time it takes to
switch on and off to help us decide on the optimal tradeoff.
</p>
<p>
Our current (fully hand-wavey) estimates are for a dipole force
application time of 1 ms and amplification and recooling times of 1
ms, so I suppose that our on/off times can be roughly of that order as
a starting point for testing.
</p>
<p>
P.S. Matthias sent a useful link for windows (with their FFTs) that
are optimised to have good cutoffs of higher frequencies here:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function</a>
</p>
<p>
From these, the "Blackman" and "Flattop" windows seem to be good
places to start.

<p>Part of the problem with different powers in the two arms was down to
the fact the BS I was using looked like it was a PBS (despite being
labelled as 50:50). That has been replaced by one that appears to
behave as if it is a 50:50 (or perhaps a PBS for a different
wavelength!). There is still a significant drift in the power coming
out of the fibre (~10 %) which should be treated eventually, if it
becomes important.
</p>
<p>
After this I felt I improved the matching of the focii of the two arms
but the contrast of the interference has drastically reduced (not
worth measuring right now). This may still be an alignment issue.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">

<p>I found a flat piezo from Piezomechanik, but according to their
catalog it is a multilayer stack. From the looks of it, it is one of
the model that has 4 to 3 um stroke (specifically model HPST
150/15-8-3) and stiffness 1800 N/um. 
</p>
<p>
I've also fished out another of the old Noliac piezos, which I believe
had a smaller stroke than that, but that needs repairing. UPDATE:
Model of the Noliac found: CMAR03. Free stroke 2.3 um, stiffness 950
N/um.
</p>
<p>
The question is whether minimum stroke or maximum stiffness is the
most important factor when considering the stability of the
element. It seems a pattern in the Piezomechanik catalog that
stiffness decreases with length of the PZT and increases with
cross-section, and the model of actuator we have from them has just
about the maximum stiffness. I'm tempted to go with the Piezomechanik
one instead of the Noliac. A) because the increased stiffness seems
like it would be a good indicator of stability, B) because a smaller
stroke only gives us stability against electronic noise, which we are
likely to have relatively little of, and C) because the Noliacs are
more expensive/rare.

<p>I've mounted the PZT on a standard mirror mount with a mirror designed
for 0 deg. reflection at 850, which is the closest wavelength I could
find. The power of the beams in the interferometer are actually
mismatched because this mirror is better than the one I used for the
other arm (250 uW vs 200 uW), although some of that might have
something to do with the focussing and de-focussing lenses. 
</p>
<p>
As before, interference can be seen without modulating either of the
PZTs, simply due to the jitter in path lengths. Using this as an
indicator of overlap, it's quite easy to get a good overlap over a
pretty long path length (up to 2 meters). However, when we install a
photodiode close to the beamsplitter we can see that the contrast
ratio is only on the order of 1/8, which indicates that there is bad
matching of the modes of the two arms of the interferometer. In fact
it's clear visually that they are different, particularly when looking
at the spot size at long distances. Some work should be done to try
to match the focal lengths better. It might also be interesting to
look at the contrast ratio further along the beam to see if that is
informative in any way.

<p>Matthias agrees that one of the standard PZTs might be too unstable
for the second arm of the interferometer. He doesn't have a feeling
for whether or not a translation stage would be more stable, but
regardless is skeptical that they will provide sufficient precision
unless we buy an expensive model. The suggestion is that we find one
of the short, flat PZTs we might have lying around, that have a
shorter stroke and likely a higher stability.

<p>Discussions after lunch yesterday with the molecule group rounded up
as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>Kevin and Amy will work on programming an SRS function generator so
  that we can turn off and on the cooling laser adiabatically
  i.e. without causing the ion to be kicked. This will need to be done
  when we are switching on the optical dipole force so that the ions
  can oscillate without damping from the cooling laser. This should be
  a case of mapping the response of the AOM and programming the
  function generator to compensate for it to give the correct pulse
  shape. 
</li>
<li>I should carry on working on the interferometer, whilst also
  thinking about simulations of the above adiabatic switching, and the
  first steps of the programming required for automation of the
  experiment. 
</li>
<li>We must consider (probably via simulation) whether a second calcium
  ion would help us out in this specific experiment. Presumably we
  would lose acceleration from the dipole force by a factor of 1/3,
  but would gain in fluorescence by a factor of 2?

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">

<p>Kevin started taking a look at the adiabatic switching using the SRS
function generator. The approach we'd have to take is to program the
whole cooling laser intensity sequence for the experiment, into the
generator. 
</p>
<p>
The limit here is that we only have 1000 points for the whole
wavefunction. Matthias estimates that a soft maximum for the dipole
force exposure is 1 ms. If we estimate that we amplify and recool over
a period of 1 ms, that gives our waveform a time-resolution of 2
us. 
</p>
<p>
The time-period over which we must switch off the laser must
correspond to a frequency much lower than the secular frequency of the
trap (approx. 100 kHz), say by a factor of 100. This gives us a switch
off time of 1 kHz, or 1 ms. That's long enough to give good resolution
over the switching period. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand however, to simplify the process we could just try
using a low pass filter at 1 kHz to try and achieve the same
effect. The trade-off for that simplicity will be the potential danger
of ringing affects from higher frequencies, but since it's such a
simple system we might as well give it a go?

<p>Had been struggling a bit with coupling, was stupidly using APC
coupler, and now switched to an old, crappy PC coupler I found. Still
only got 40 uW out of a possible mW though, while the coupling and
lens are about maximal. At first glance the fibre looks to be the
problem, since it doesn't transmit much light from the fibre alignment
pen any more (despite having done so fairly well just yesterday).

<p>The fibre was dud, and it's been labelled and put away. Hopefully it's
just damage to the surface of the fibre and it can be polished and
re-used at some point. 
</p>
<p>
The replacement fibre has given us 1.5 mW out from a total 4.1 mW. I
didn't spend much time re-optimising the lens position and so the
extra 30% or so we expect can probably got from there when it becomes
relevant.

<p>
The dipole interferometer setup that must now be built is shown again
in Fig. <a href="#fig-dipole_int">dipole<sub>int</sub></a>. The actively controlled PZT on the
right-hand side is used to overlap the standing wave with the ion for
the optimal amplitude of the dipole force, and to compensate for any
deviations of the optical path-length detected by the interferometer.
</p>
<p>
The length of the second arm of the interferometer can
also be adjusted in order to maintain maximum sensitivity in the
interferometry signal, regardless of the overlap of the standing wave
with the ion. I'm wondering right now though, whether this could
potentially introduce a troublesome drift in the overlap with the ion,
since any drift in the top PZT (which is not actively
position-compensated), will result in unwanted `compensation' of the
right-hand PZT by the feedback system. Would a micrometer stage be
better/more stable? I guess it would need sub-micrometer precision and
high stability, but that should be manageable. The question is which
is more stable, a PZT or a micrometer stage?

<p>According to the project plan (<a href="StateDetection.gan">file</a>), I should have finished with this
(a week ago!) and be onto designing and automating the state-detection
experiment! Of course we forgot to take into account my two weeks away
so it's hardly a realistic timescale. 
</p>
<p>
Regardless the trap hasn't started baking yet so I still have time to
work on the interferometer setup before it's required on the main
table. Hopefully Kevin is also on his way as far as software goes, but
I need to have a chat with him about that.
</p>
<p>
The notes of last month say I managed only 67% efficiency out of the
AOM at last take. I think it can be better given that we are only
single pass and have a lot of freedom as far as our choice of lens
goes, but it will do for now in order to get going with the
interferometry. Next up is to couple the output of the AOM to a fibre,
and then build a test interferometry setup on the laser table.

<p>Matthias and Jack seem to be under the impression that the problem is
down to the power in the dye laser. This in turn is likely to be a
problem with the power from the pump laser, which Chris Rennick from
Oxford had a look at. He says that it needs some regular maintanence,
and probably a new flashbulb. An engineer has been called and a visit
will be arranged soon by Jack.

<p>Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:
</p>
<p>
"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.
</p>
<p>
By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."
</p>
<p>
Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(<a href="http://www.microchip.com/">http://www.microchip.com/</a>). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

<li>There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
</li>
<li>Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
</li>
<li>Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
