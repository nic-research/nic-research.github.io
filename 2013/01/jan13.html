<p>Usage of the provided dlls appears to be fairly straightforward, at
  first glance. From looking at some of Wolfgang's old code, it looks
  like using a dll is just a case of including it as a header file in
  your code. Then you can call the functions of the dll (the
  prototypes of which are in the manual) in your main code.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, I must write the header and a .lib file myself, and
  then include the dll in the same folder as the compiled
  executable. The function prototypes for the header are included in
  the manual, as are the export commands for the .lib file.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-10-30 Tue</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The header file can be copied straight from the manual. Likewise the
  export library:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="DP7888.h">header source</a>
</li>
<li><a href="DP7888.lib">export library</a>
</li>
<li><a href="DP7888.dll">DP7888 dll</a>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I'm still not sure how the export library part works. Hopefully
  I can just have the file in the same folder as the program and it
  will use it to link my code to the .dll.
</p>
<p>
Need a windows computer to work with in my office&hellip; waiting on the
  ITS guys to install on my old laptop.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-05 Mon</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Started work at home using visual studio (still waiting on a windows
  installation at work). 
</p>
<p>
The compiler doesn't recognise some of the
  declarations in the header file I copied over. In particular
  qualifiers such as the "HUGE" and "FAR" in e.g. lines 106 &amp; 107 :
</p><pre class="example">
unsigned long HUGE *s0;
unsigned long far *region;"
</pre>


<p>
Neither does the compiler recognise the data type (?) "HANDLE" in
  e.g. line 110:
</p><pre class="example">
HANDLE hs0;
</pre>


<p>
It looks like HANDLE and other unrecognised types are defined in the
  headers "windef.h" and "windows.h". I haven't confirmed where HUGE
  and FAR are defined yet however.
</p>
<p>
"far" and "HUGE" are pointer data type qualifiers with similar
  functionality. My impression is that they deal with addressing
  memory spaces that are wider than the data types that address them.
</p>
<p>
"far" has been recognised with the inclusion of the windef.h header
  (declared inside the DP7888.h file), but "HUGE" is still
  unresolved.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore the inclusion of windef.h has caused the compiler to
  throw up a bunch of other errors.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-06 Tue</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the data types and qualifiers in the header are
  undefined. Definitions for all but the qualifier "HUGE" are found in
  "windef.h" standard library, but that's no guarantee that it's the
  correct definition. Sent an e-mail to info@fastcomtec.com to inquire
  as to the correct dependencies.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Wagner of Fastcomtec:
  "our software worked already in Windows 3.1, here programs could use
   different memory models named small, large and huge. The word huge
   was an attribute to pointers. This is now obsolete and you may just 
   delete this word or write a line
</p><pre class="example">
#define HUGE
</pre>

<p>   at the beginning of your program."
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-08 Thu</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Hiroki pointed out the correct way to call a function from a third
  party dll using  `explicit linking' (there are many examples under
  that search term). The header file is only required to declare the
  structures that are arguments for the functions and to mimic their
  prototyping in the explicit linking code. The .def file is not
  required, but the ordinal representation given can probably be used
  instead of the function names when looking for the function
  pointers.
</p>
<p>
No luck yet as far as running the program on the server machine
  goes. Plan A was to test calling the dll by starting the server, but
  we can't do that without initialising a valid window handle, which I
  don't know exactly how to do.
</p>
<p>
Instead we try extracting information from the server after running
  it manually, using GetSettingData(). Sadly this causes a crash when
  run on the server machine, and the error report is not
  helpful. It might be a good idea to compile and debug on that
  machine specifically, in order to get more information on the
  error.
</p>
<p>
Haven't managed to install visual studio on the target
  computer. It's generally flipping out and not letting me install
  anything, so I don't know how far I can trust it in general. Doing
  some diagnostic work on it to figure out its problems before going
  any further.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-12 Mon</span></span>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
(Friday): Doesn't work on the other computer with a p7888 either
  (Manati). Same error.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the program probably wasn't calling the dll
  properly, thanks to spaces in the library path not being handled
  properly. The dll and path have been moved to "C:\", though I could
  and probably should use one in System32 folder.
</p>
<p>
Fixing this problem allowed the program to run on Manati (and it
  probably would on the other computer too), but it didn't return the
  correct value of the variable that the program tries to extract from
  the server.
</p>
<p>
(Monday): The function I've called maybe doesn't read the settings
  saved to the server. The header included in the manual states that
  it read the settings saved to the dll, and there are two functions
  in the dll for saving settings, with only one explicitly saving to
  the dll. That implies that the other saves settings locally (?). I
  must make sure 
  a) that when using the GUI, I use the save setting that saves to the
  dll (if there is one)
  b) that the program I'm using accessess the same dll that is being
  used by the server (the dll in the System32 folder).
</p>
<p>
If there is no option to save to dll in the GUI, I should load that
  function up into my program, so that I can write to the dll and then
  read from it.
</p>
<p>
Success. The program correctly reads the updated settings from the
  dll in the system32 folder, after they are changed using the p7888
  server program (run manually).

<li>Counting card, model p7888

</li>
<li>Analysis code written in c for speed - can I make anything of
  Wolfgang's code for the micromotion compensation counting cards?

</li>
<li>Does our model of p7888 include a GO line?
<ul>
<li>It doesn't look like it has an external connection to it, but
    there should in principle be one somewhere internally
</li>
<li>However the Start line isn't being used in the configuration for
    optical kicking experiment &ndash;&gt; It must be being used in "time
    difference" or "differential" mode, described in the hardware
    manual. The output is time differences from the inital pulse in
    channel 1 or channel 2, as opposed to differences from the start
    pulse.
</li>
<li>Ask Kevin how his experiment is automated (not in today - e-mail)

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Pulse sequence is set by pulse generator
<ul>
<li>2 outputs, one controls the AM input of the VCO, the other
    controls the RF switch
</li>
<li>RF switch switches to VCO at different frequency in order to
    amplify the kick
</li>
<li>Is there a second switch that simultaneously starts the RF
    switcher and counting card?

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>NB counting card settings: DMA mode is for rates higher than 1 MHz
  and should be disabled for lower count-rates (not sure why yet)

</li>
<li>(X -&gt; see [16-10-2012]) Hardware manual suggests that an option for
  "synchronising" the p7888 card with the experiment is to use
  wrap-around mode, which counts continuously (counter wraps back to
  zero when maxed), and to use the `sync out' output to synchronise
  with the experiment. I'm not sure this is the most efficient way we
  can get this done, but it might work if I can't find exactly what
  I'm looking for

</li>
<li>It is possible to use the digital inputs (internal) to start the
  system, according to the manual

</li>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-10-16 Tue</span></span>
</li>
<li>Wrap around mode probably is the best way forward. If
  we can use DMA at the same time, then acquisition can happen in

<li>Ideally this way the data would never have to actually be written to
  disk (slow). However this requires access to whatever space the DMA
  writes to (RAM?), and I haven't yet found any information on that
  yet.

</li>
<li>Might have to buy the appropriate dlls from the manufacturer for the

Hiroki wrote communication vi's to send commands to the p7888. It's
  not a difficult process anyway. All communication done with DDE vis
  (inbuilt) and the commands that need to be sent are in the p7888
  manual.

<p>The whole thing can be written in Labview using the aforementioned
  DDE vis, but in all likelihood this will be a slow process and lead
  to a lot of dead-time
</p>
<p>
One idea was, in order to have something working quickly, to write
  the whole thing in LabVIEW, and then slowly replace components with
  faster c-code as required. This would be quicker if the time taken
  to learn to program the card directly with c is
  significant.
</p>
<p>
However, I'm not sure it's really all that difficult, and rather
  than put effort into code I will eventually have to throw away
  (LabVIEW vi's), it might be a better idea to start straight from c.

<p>The way dll functions are accessed is somewhat cumbersome. After the
library is loaded (LoadLibrary()) we extract the required function
pointer from the library (GetProcAddress()). We must then do a
`mock-prototype' of the function using typedef, which obviously
requires the function argument and return types. The extracted
function pointer is then typecast to the type defined latterly and
defined with the name you want it to have (all details can be found
with a quick search on "explicit linking" for dlls).
</p>
<p>  
The latter lines are not nice code to read, and I would rather have
it hidden in a function library called in a header. The problem
with this is that no single function can easily be written that
deals with all the different argument and return types that the
functions I'm loading have. Since there needs to be a typecast, the
argument types must be passed to the calling function, and I'm not
sure there's an easy way to do that.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-14 Wed</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A reasonable approach to the problem (previous entry), would be to do
 the typedefs that amount to function prototyping in a header. With
 this approach all I would need to do is call LoadLibrary() once, at
 the start of the main, and then GetProcAddress() for each function
 that I need to use, and do declaration and typecasting. This reduces
 each function-loading to three lines - which is nice - but calls for
 a bunch of different typedefs which must be labelled sensibly and
 understandably - which might be difficult.
</p>
<p> 
 I think it'd be convenient to have all of the definitions written out
 once in a header though, because then I'd only have to do that work
 once. There's quite a lot of return-argument combinations, so I might
 as well get it all out of the way.
</p>
<p>
 The above works just fine. I have written out all the
 typedef/prototypes into the same header file that contains the
 data-type definitions.
</p>
<p> 
 This simplifies the structure of the program: It can be a single
 executable running all of the functionality of the experiment. The
 only question is to make sure that we can extract data from it and
 give it parameters from LabVIEW. This should be possible by writing
 data and reading parameters to and from file, or maybe by using a vi
 in LabVIEW.
</p>
<p>
 NB there seems to be some standard protocols for inter-application
 communications e.g. ActiveX
</p>
<p> 
 Using ActiveX, I would need to set up my application as an ActiveX
 server so that my LabVIEW program, an ActiveX client, can access data
 and functions of it. This can all be done after the main program
 functionality is written.

</li>
</ul>

<p>Delving deeper into the modes of operation:
</p><ul>
<li>Stop-after-sweep mode awaits a start signal, and then records stop
    signals until the specified amount of time has passed. 200 ns after
    this, the device is ready to receive a new start signal to take a
    new sweep. It's not clear whether or not this becomes an entirely
    new spectrum, or whether it is `added' on top of the last in a
    histogram.
</li>
<li>Wrap-around mode has no start triggers, I think. It runs
    continuously, recording stop trigger times from the start of the
    measurement. If the apparatus is unsynchronised with the card, then
    the user must be sure to track rollovers in the cards 36-bit
    timer. However, if the user starts the experiment with a trigger
    from one of the clock bits, then the experiment is synchronised with
    the card i.e. all time data will be with reference to the clock
    trigger, and higher clock bits can be discarded. It's not clear
    whether data is written as a long list of arrival times or `binned'
    on board the card.
</li>
<li>Sequential mode is like Stop-after-sweep mode, but the manual states
    that it takes a specified number of sweeps before the "FIFO is
    emptied, the corresponding spectra closed and a new sequence with
    the same number of sweeps is started".
</li>
</ul>


<p>
  The last line of the sequential mode description implies that each
  sweep, associated with a period following the start trigger, is
  considered an individual spectrum. The wrap-around mode operation
  implies that the data is recorded simply as a long list of arrival
  times. These are not necessarily exclusive, and since there's only one
  type of data structure defined in the header, I guess there's a way
  that the definitions go together. Perhaps all the data in wrap-around
  mode is considered a single spectrum.
</p>
<p>
  It would be a good idea to look at the structure of the data that gets
  written to file. While I'm at it, I will write down the settings
  typically used.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-16 Fri</span></span> 
</li>
</ul>

<p>Manual information on the data formats:
</p>
<p>  
   "Spectra data files with extension .asc contain in each line one
   decimal number in ASCII containing the corresponding count value in
   the histogram.
</p>
<p>   
   Binary data files with extension .dat are written with 4 bytes per
   data value, as usual in the Intel world in reverse order i.e. the
   least significant byte comes first.
</p>
<p>
   Another ASCII file format is the x y format with extension .csv. It
   can be read for example with Excel and contains the channel number
   and content as two decimal numbers in ASCII per line separated by a
   TAB character."
</p>
<p>
  "List files have the extension .lst and start with a header
   containing the usual report and configuration data in ASCII as in the
   .888 files. The header ends with a line containing [DATA].  Then
   follows the data, depending on the format chosen for the data file
   either in ASCII one number per line, or in binary 4 bytes per number,
   as usual in the Intel world in the reverse order, i.e. the least
   significant byte comes first.
</p>
<p>
   The highest 1 or 2 bits contain the information from which input the
   event did arise: when using the two input mode with 1 nsec time
   resolution, only the highest bit 31 is used for the channel
   identification, 0 means input channel 1, 1 means input channel 2. The
   start event is a 32 bit data value with only bit 31 set to 1."
</p>
<p>
  i.e. the start event reads 80000000h in hex, or -2147483648 in
  ASCII. 
</p>
<p>
  Either sequential or wrap-around mode is the mode we need to
  use. Ideally wrap-around mode, but I'm still not sure what the
  format of the data is in this mode. For instance does it write a
  .dat/asc histogram, or just a list file. The manual only talks about
  list file behaviour when describing the mode. 
</p>
<p>  
  NB if using wrap-around mode the optical kicking must be triggered
  via the p7888 clock. This can be achieved by using it as the
  external trigger to the pulse generator. This isn't a very flexible
  approach, but it probably doesn't need to be. In any case if we need
  the flexibility we can probably use the other modes with the
  time-preset function and software start.
</p>
<p>
  Assuming wrap-around mode makes spectrum data then the appropriate
  settings would be:
</p>
<pre class="example">
settings.savedata = 0; //no saving
settings.fmt = 1; //binary format
settings.sweepmode = 0x28; //wrap-around and Softw. start
</pre>


<p>
  If we were to use the regular stop-after-sweep mode with time preset
  and software start, then we would need to provide a start pulse to
  the p7888 from the pulse generator (this is the way we are doing
  things now), in that case the settings would be:
</p>
<pre class="example">
settings.sweepmode = 0x8; //normal mode with Sofw. start
</pre>


<p>
  In the end, I'm leaning towards the latter option, as opposed to the
  wrap-around mode, mostly because it seems to work already. If the
  manual were clearer, I might be able to be more confident about that
  choice.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of the operation mode, we should be able to avoid saving
  data to file by using either GetData() to get a data pointer and
  read the data directly, or using LVGetDat() to copy the spectrum to
  an array. 
</p>
<p>
  If the data is available in spectrum format, then each time we
  access data to perform an fft, the spectrum (or indeed the entire
  measurement) must be reset, in order to get a fast reponse to any
  changes in the experiment.  
</p>
<p>
  If the data is available in list format, then we must bin and
  histogram the list ourselves, and perhaps delete old timestamps in
  order to save memory space if the experiment runs for a long time.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-19 Mon</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm starting to put together what will become the main
program. There's some good progress in that I have succesfully started
a measurement using the dll Start() function, and can (I think) use
some of the other functions such as GetSettingData() and
GetDefData(). 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, one of the important functions that I might need to use
is not returning what I would expect of it. GetStatusData() throws up
no errors in calling, but simply returns "0" in all of the fields of
the ACQSTATUS type variable that I pass (via pointer) to it. The
fields of the variable are:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int started;     //aquisition status: 1 if running, 0 else
double runtime;  //running time in seconds
double totalsum; //total events
double roisum;   //events within ROI
double roirate;  //acquired ROI-events per second
double nettosum; //ROI sum with background subtracted
double sweeps;   //Number of sweeps
double stevents; //Start Events;
unsigned long maxval; //Maximum value in spectrum
} ACQSTATUS;
</pre>


<p>
It's quite possible that under normal test circumstances most of
these could be zero, since there's no actual input to the p7888. But
calling this function whilst the card is running should give us a
non-zero "started" value. It would be worthwhile checking if any of
the other values are misbehaving by getting them to be
non-zero. The "sweeps" variable should be the easiest to change and
test. Also, I haven't actually looked at ".runtime" whilst its running
yet. In face that would definitely be the easiest approach.
</p>
<p>
One explanation for this function not working is that I'm not defining
the correct "nDisplay" argument. GetDefData() tells me that theres 4
modules (inputs?) and 2 displays. I'm not entirely sure what this
means. Entering values for nDisplay between 0..3 however gives no
errors or differences in the result. UPDATE: Of course, I've already
succesfully called the GetSettingData() function which takes the
nDisplay argument, which kind of moots this as the source of the
problem.

</ul>

<p>A suggestion from Hiroki: Rather than have the program communicate
with LabView via ActiveX, it could essentially be written as a
function and compiled into my own dll. We could then use LabVIEW to
call the function in the dll and extract the outputs. It's worth
looking in to whether or not this is feasible, rather than having to
learn to program ActiveX.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the problems with the status function, I can more or less
ignore it anyway: it's nice, but not necessary. On a related note, it
would be worthwhile at some point looking into whether or not the
hardware IOs would be useful to use. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-21 Wed</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I have started taking some example spectra using the pulse generator
as an input to the p7888. As expected "spectra" are histograms of the
stop events relative to the start event, and list files are a list of
arrival times relative to the stop event. We need to decide which
measurement mode we want to use, so here are my notebook comments on
each mode:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-sweep-mode. Runs indefinitely (unless one of the condition
  variables is set), continuously adds to the spectrum and writes
  listfile. "Range" and "ROI" give the span of time after a start
  pulse during which stop pulses will be recorded and sent. As far as
  I understand it, the card will send out the spectrum, or the
  additions to the list file after "Range" time has elapsed. "Time
  preset" will stop the measurement after the set amount of
  time. "Sweep preset" will stop the measurement after the set amount
  of sweeps (a new sweep is started with each start event). "Event
  preset" will stop the measurement after the set amount of stop
  events.
</li>
<li>Sequential-mode. Activated by turning on 2D spectra. This functions
  exactly like the mode above, except that if there is a stop
  condition then in sequential-mode the measurement will repeat
  according to the "sequences" variable set by the user. Rather than
  them being added to each other, the spectrum from each new sequence
  is appended to the spectra from previous sequences.
</li>
<li>Wrap-around-mode. This mode has no external start pulse. The clock
  simply runs indefinitely, and the card outputs the time stamp of
  stop pulses (how does it write spectra? I don't know yet, but I'm
  about to check). I believe setting "Softw. start" to true will give
  us an artifical start at the beginning of the experiment, meaning
  that the time stamps will be relative to that time. The utility of
  this mode is that the clock bits are accessible as digital output on
  the card, and can therefore be used to trigger the
  experiment. e.g. If I use the 20th bit of the card's clock as a
  trigger for the optical kicking experiment I will get a repetition
  rate of roughly 1kHz. Since all the lower bits reset at each
  trigger, any time stamps I now receive are with respect to the start
  of the experiment, as long as I ignore any bits higher than 19.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
N.B. I don't yet know positively whether or not wrap-around-mode outputs
a meaningful histogram spectrum as the other modes do. Since there is
a syncout variable set in the dll that tells the software which bit I
am using to as an output, it's conceivable that it might use that to
know how to histogram the data, but it's certainly not a given.
</p>
<p>
By the nature of the experiment, single-sweep and wrap-around modes
would require us to periodically reset the histogram bins to
zero. This happens when we have enough data to measure secular
frequency to the desired precision. If we don't reset the histogram
then changes to the state of the system will not be visible over the
previous collected data. This will require some synchronisation with
the analysis part of the program, so that we only delete a spectrum
immediately after we have loaded it into the analysis. This could be
accomplished by monitoring the "runtime" or "sweeps" properties of the
status, (but would obviously require that function to work, which it
doesn't right now!).
</p>
<p>
Alternatively we could read the list info and, using only the
timestamps from the previous x sweeps, make our own `streaming'
histogram from that info. This may be the only way we can use
wrap-around mode anyway, depending on how it handles spectra.
</p>
<p>
The other alternative is to use sequential-mode, and set the number of
sequences higher than we expect to need. This will automatically give
us time-evolving spectra. In principal this is good, but I'm worried
about using up too much memory if any stage of the experiment goes on
for too long.
</p>
<p>
So far right now, for the sake of hardware simplicity and simplicity
of memory access and storage, I'm leaning towards using
single-sweep-mode and periodically deleting the spectrum. I believe
this is the most flexible option for us. It really depends on us
having access to the runtime or number of sweeps for
synchronisation. This means either getting the GetStatusData()
function working, or accessing the hardware outputs.

<p>The status function is actually going to be a lot more useful than I
previously thought. My software needs a way to keep track of how long
a measurement has been going, so that we can extract data at the
appropriate time and clear the histogram <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-21 Wed</span></span>.
</p>
<p>
My options are to use the status function to get run time or sweep
counts from the card, use hardware I/Os, or to synchronise with an
external timer. By far the easiest of all of these options is the
status function.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Update - Well it turns out the status function was working fine,
  it's just that before starting a measurement all of the status
  variables members <i>are</i> zero, and I wasn't waiting long enough after
  the start command for the card to start and update its
  status. i.e. the program was going through the whole instruction set
  before the device had updated its status.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Now that this function is working, I can start and stop the program
for a specified length of time by monitoring the status.runtime
variable, or I can stop according to the number of sweeps using the
status.sweeps variable. 
</p>
<ul>
<li id="sec-1-3-4-1">Aside<br/>
N.B. Some testing needs to go in to finding out the reponse time of
the card to commands from my program - I noticed that when I set the
stop time to 10 s, the actual run time on the server program read
10.22. That's a significant discrepancy, considering optical kicking
experiments are expected to be on the order of the difference (~100
ms).

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-22 Thu</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The important question now is how to extract and operate on the
spectra. The appropriate sounding functions in the dll header are:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int GetData(ACQDATA FAR *Data, int nDisplay); //Get data pointers
long GetSpec(long i, int nDisplay); //Get a spectrum value
void GetBlock(long FAR *hist, int start, int end, int step, int ...
   ... nDisplay); //Get a block of spectrum data
int LVGetDat(unsigned long *datp, int nDisplay); //Copies the ...
   ... spectrum to an array
</pre>


<p>
This function might also help during debugging:
</p>
<pre class="example">
void SaveData(int nDevice); //Saves data
</pre>


<p>
The function "GetData()" takes an argument of type ACQDATA, which is
structured as follows:
</p>
<pre class="example">
typedef struct{
   unsigned long *s0 //pointer to spectrum
   unsigned long far *region // pointer to regions
   unsigned char far *comment0; //pointer to strings
   double far *cnt; //pointer to counters
   HANDLE hs0;
   HANDLE hrg;
   HANDLE hcm;
   HANDLE hct;
} ACQDATA
</pre>


<p>
So this function provides us a pointer to the spectrum *s0. We can
read the number of channels in a spectrum from the "settings.range"
(I'm not sure if this is adjusted for bin width, but we can also find
binwidth in: "settings.bitshift" (Binwidth = 2 ^
(bitshift))). Therefore we can extract the entire spectrum using
pointer arithmetic. My guess, however, is that this is all that the
function "LVGetDat()" does anyway, so we can probably declare an array
that's far too long in the first place, pass it to the latter function
to write the data, and then only use the first N entries (where N =
settings.range) for analysis.
</p>
<p>
"GetSpec()" doesn't seem particularly useful for our purposes, but for
the optical kicking experiment specifically, GetBlock() might be handy
for picking out the regions of amplification and re-cooling, where
data is most significant. On the other hand of course we could just
define the regions of interest (ROIs) before the experiment, so that
the spectra would include only these regions anyway.
</p>
<p>
For simple debugging purposes I should write some code that will take
the written array and write it to file. This will let me check that I
have written all of the data and that it makes sense. I can also later
use these arrays to provide sanity-checks on my in-program data
analysis.
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-23 Fri</span></span>

<p>GetData() function not working. After compiling, the IDE complains
about the pointer to the comment strings, saying it's a bad pointer,
but I'm not sure if this is the problem. When the debugger gets to the
GetData function it gets an "unhandled exception error" and dies. 
</p>
<p>
The compiler doesn't complain if I erase the comment string pointer
from the typedef altogether, but the same exception error comes up.
</p>
<p>
I wondered if this was to do with the fact that I was calling the
function after the measurement had finished and written the data to
file (therefore nothing there to read?) but if I call it before the
Halt() command I get the same exception error.
</p>
<p>
<i>Update:</i> I never managed to get the GetData() function working, I'm not
sure why. I initialised all of the pointers in the structure to the
values of arrays that I declared previously, but I don't know how to
initialise the handles, so I just initialised them to the value of
those same pointers. No luck.
</p>
<p>
Instead I've gone with the original plan which is to use LVGetDat() on
a previously declared array. I didn't write it in the above notes,
but I attempted this before going for the GetData() function but had
some problems with declarations (probably a typo). Anyway all I do is
pass a pointer to an array that is longer than is likely to be needed,
and the function writes the data to that array. I've put in a little
check at the beginning of the program to make sure that the data range
is not larger than the buffer, so that the acquisition will not start
if that's the case.
</p>
<p>
On top of this I've written a little function that writes the array to
file at the end of the program. It seems quite slow (but I need to do
a more rigorous check to find out if it is), but it's not going to be
a final feature of the experiment anyway. At some point a thorough
rundown of execution times needs to be done to iron out bottlenecks.

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-26 Mon</span></span>

</ul>

<p>Managed to get the GetData() function called without exception errors,
but unfortunately it doesn't actually write anything to the ACQDATA
variable (all pointers left uninitialised).
</p>
<p>
If I could get it working I could be sure that no extra copying of
data was being done. LVGetData() comments say it copies the data to an
array, which implies that it doesn't simply copy the pointer to the
data over, but the whole data set, which would be costly. I wonder if
it's likely that an operation like that will be a bottleneck for the
process though.

<p>I've nabbed a file called <a href="analyse_single_data_set_p7888/FFT.c#include-algorithm">FFTg.c</a> from on of Wolfgang's old program
folders for analysing data from the p7888. It utilises the
"Danielson-Laczos" algorithm for computing the FFT, which I understand
is an efficient algorithm. However the code is a little difficult to
read, and without further documentation, I might consider writing my
own simple (and probably quite slow) fft algorithm on ASCII data. Once
everything else is in place then I can look at fast algorithms like
this for computing on binary data.
</p>
<p>
For now I might use what seems to be a well-documented and recommended
library called FFTW (<a href="http://www.fftw.org/">http://www.fftw.org/</a>). There doesn't appear to be
support for integer FFT in this library, but looking at Wolfgang's
code it doesn't take integer inputs either (double instead). In face
looking at the code from which the FFT.c code is called from
(<a href="analyse_single_data_set_p7888/ReadP7888SingleChannel.c">ReadP7888SingleChannel.c</a>), it looks like Wolfgang is just typecasting
his ints to doubles (i.e. 1 -&gt; 1.0) and then passing them to the
function. I'm going to try this with the FFTW library since I'm not
sure I fully understand Wolfgang's implementation. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally I want to add dynamic memory allocation for the data
array so that it matches the length of the incoming data
histogram. This is a more elegant and memory efficient (like that
matters) solution than the current approach of declaring a
ridiculously large array &lt;update: that worked fine&gt;.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-27 Tue</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Accessing the FFTW library seemed like more work than it was
worth. Instead I gave a go at using Wolfgang's code, since it's pretty
much the same application. I only have a single pulse as a signal to
test the FFT on, but what I got out was what I expect i.e. a flat
spectrum. There doesn't seem to be good normalisation, but maybe
that's to be expected.
</p>
<p>
In any case the fact that I'm getting a flat spectrum from an impulse
is not necessary proof that it works. Kevin and Amy are setting up an
electronic kicking experiment this afternoon, and with luck I'll be
able to apply my program to their setup to see the outcome on real
data.
</p>
<p>
While they get that up and running I might as well do a bit of the
`frequency-detection' programming, since the output format of the FFT
will always be the same. After that I can look at
`amplitude-detection' for loading and dipole force measurement.
</p>
<p>
A simple first-draft would just look for the index of the max element
and give the corresponding frequency. If we could tell it in advance
what the expected frequency range is, then this might be robust enough
for the final application. Fitting a Lorentzian would be the more general solution. It could be
used to measure amplitude and also frequency in other experiments.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-28 Wed</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a simple peak-detection algorithm, how can the system decide
whether or not there is an ion in the trap? Perhaps I'm
over-complicating things - I don't really need an FFT just to check
whether or not there's an ion. I can simply take an average reading of
the fluorescence rate. With an average reading, I could either set a
threshold rate above which I can say I have an ion, or I could wait to
detect a change in the mean fluorescence.
</p>
<p>
Using fluorescence detection would probably be a quite useful thing to
do throughout the experiment, in order that we can detect the loss of
an ion during a run. Threshold detection is probably sufficient for
most cases.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-29 Thu</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I managed to run the program on a kicking experiment on Amy's trap and
succesfully extract the correct secular frequency. The program runs
very slowly on that machine though. I noticed what seemed to be some
variable command latency in the previous machine (Manati) on the order
of a few hundred msec. On this one however there seems to be several
seconds of command latency. However I didn't shut down any of the
programs running in the background, which might help.
</p>
<p>
Currently the experiment is set to take data of 10 sec, which is far
longer than we would like to wait to identify the secular frequency of
an ion crystal. Amy says that that's the best she can do at the
moment, but hopefully some optimisation will bring those times down to
sub-second by the time we want to do some real experiments.
</p>
<ul>
<li>NB fluorescence-level detection wasn't working
  properly. Calculated fluorescence rate came out orders of magnitude
  too low. However I think it's a simple matter of getting the right
  conversion factor 

</li>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-05 Wed</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with fluorescence-level detection was just bad
programming. Fluorescence detection now works properly. The program is
a fully functioning kicking experiment initiation and analysis that
will extract the secular frequency of the ion in the trap.

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-05 Wed</span></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The current program is compiled as an .exe that uses the measurement
settings defined on the server software. It would be trivial to define
the settings from within the compiled program, but that is perhaps not
flexible enough for general use, requiring the user to edit source and
compile in order to change settings.
</p>
<p>
The most basic alternative is to pass arguments to the exe upon
calling it from the command line. Doing this manually isn't
reasonable, but the user could edit a configuration file that could be
passed to the exe instead. 
</p>
<p>
A more user-friendly experience would be to make a LabVIEW vi that has
setting controls that are sent, ensemble, to the exe upon calling. In
LabVIEW, calling a exe with options requires writing and calling a
batch file with the required commands via the "System Exec VI".
</p>
<p>
Using this technique, we would require that the exe write the analysed
data to file, and that LabVIEW would read and display it. Any
interaction with devices apart from the p7888 would also have to be
managed in this way. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The better alternative has already been mentioned: Hiroki has compiled
DLLs for use in LabVIEW before, and claims its a fairly
straightforward job. There's no need to compile .lib or .def files - I
would guess that LabVIEW gets everything it needs from the dll header
file.
</p>
<p>
This would require that we write the program as a function instead of
an executable. That way LabVIEW can pass all the relevant settings as
arguments to the function, and extract all the relevant data as
returns from it.
</p>
<p>
Interactions with devices other than the p7888 could then be handled
entirely within LV, which would be ideal.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this UI strategy, I think that the best design for the
automation software is to break it up into three separate DLLs, each
associated with the different phases of the experiment: Ca loading, N2
loading, and state detection. Each DLL is then a function which
performs the correct procedure, monitoring data until the specific
conditions of the experiment are met. At this point the function exits
with the desired return.
</p>
<p>
It's not clear to me whether or not this will allow us to read data,
such as the secular frequency or fluorescence level, in realtime. In
principle if we pass a variable from LV to the function, and have that
variable updated during the function call, then LV can read it whilst
the function is running and show it as it updates. I suppose that this
depends on the function running in a different thread than the other
operations of LV. 
</p>
<p>
Making each repetition of the experiment a separate LV call of the DLL
seems like it would incur unnecessary overhead, so I'm ruling that
out. There's always the possibility that the function can write to
file and LV can read it. Though I think that'd probably slow things
down a bit, I'm not sure if it would be the bottleneck for the rest of
the experiment.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first step in the process of building up the complete program
then, is to build each function as a standalone executable, and test
that it does its job properly. From there, I can write a dummy "hello
world" application to call as a dll from LV to find out its
capabilities. Then it's a case of converting each executable to a dll,
and writing the UI in LV to finish everything off.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-07 Fri</span></span> Slightly different strategy:
</li>
</ul>

<p>After speaking with Hiroki I've realised that LV would have no access
to the variables being written whilst the function was operating
unless the function ran in a separate thread. This is something that
should be possible to do within LV, but perhaps is more complexity
than we need for a first draft of the program.
</p>
<p>
The simpler approach would be to break up each operation into
time-critical and non time-critical sections. Non time-critical
commands can be executed by LV using the already made DDE-command VIs,
e.g. starting an experiment, and halting after measurements meet
specific conditions. Time-critical sections of code can run within dll
functions as long as no data is required to be extracted in
real-time. To tackle the problem of data extraction, LabV can call the
LVGetData() function (or the GetStatusData() function) from a dll.
</p>
<p>
This is certainly not going to be as fast as running everything from
within a function/executable due to the LabV overheads, but will be
quick to implement and make for easy programming of the user
interface.

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-11 Tue</span></span> Access DP7888.dll directly from LV:
</li>
</ul>

<p>I've written a .vi that accesses functions in the DP7888 dll directly
from LV using the "call library function" node. As long as the p7888
server is not in high priority mode, basic functionality is there
e.g. Start() and Halt() functions work as required. However the output
of the GetStatusData() function is garbled. This might have something
to do with the fact that its argument is a non-primitive struct, or
with byte-orders being different in C than in LV.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-13 Thu</span></span> Garbled data problem identified:
</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with data being garbled (see last entry) was identified:
There seems to have been an extra four bytes added to the data
structure after the first variable (long int, four bytes). I have no
idea where it came from or what it represents, but putting in a
padding variable to accept that piece of data makes sure that all the
following bytes are correctly assigned.
</p>
<ul>
<li>PMT program for p7888:
</li>
</ul>

<p>I've written a PMT reader program for the p7888 as a practice-run for
designing the automation project. It still relies on the settings
being given via the p7888 server for now, but the next step should be
to liberate it from any requirement of the server whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
NB getting status and settings from the card without the server
requires more than just calling e.g GetStatusData(). We must also call
the functions that request the data from card e.g. GetStatus(), which
presumably stores status data in the dll. I'm not sure if this is how
getting real spectrum data works, but it's worth bearing in mind.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Update to garbled data problem:
</li>
</ul>

<p>LV appears to insert 4 bytes before doubles i.e. 8-byte variables. It
may be coincidence, but in the data structures we're using there is
always an odd number of 4-byte variables before an 8-byte variable,
which could mean that LV is putting in the 4 bytes in order to align
the variable addresses according to 8 byte chunks. Apparently this is
a fairly typical thing, according to Stephen.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Running a program without the server:
</li>
</ul>

<p>I have incorporated the ability to change and read settings from the
PMT vi. However the program still needs the server to run properly -
starting the vi without the server results in no-data being updated.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that the server must run some initialisations, probably
defined in the ACQDEF variable mentioned in the dll header
files. According to the manual:
</p>
<p>
"At program start the configuration files
 P7888.INI and P7888A.CFG are loaded. Up to 2 P7888 modules can be
 used. Specify the number of modules in the P7888.INI file with a line
 devices=n.  You can also specify more than one module if you have only
 physical module. The software runs then for the not physical modules
 in demo mode and it is possible to load spectra and compare them in
 MCDWIN."
</p>
<p>
The ini file sets no. of devices, pll frequency, update rate and
blocksize for DMA words. The .CFG file apparently holds the default
settings. Unfortunately only the no. of devices is accessible from the
ACQDEF structure. This means we may not be able to set the proper
initialisation via the dll functions.
</p>
<p>
 <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-17 Mon</span></span> LabVIEW PMT vi for p7888:
I've been testing the vi I wrote for the p7888 that allows it to be
used as a PMT counter. Although it could probably pass as an useful
application, it suffers from some unexpected deficiencies. 
</p>
<p>
The main issue is that the vi is very sensitive to windows
priority/timing issues i.e. if any other process (such as
user-interaction with the vi) tries to take place then the count rate
varies wildly from its actual value (tested with SRS function
generator).
</p>
<p>
The GetStatusData() function call populates the ACQSTATUS variable
which stores values of the total sum of events, the runtime of the
measurement, and a variable called roirate, which seems to use the
latter two variables to calculate an event-rate per second. Given this
data-structure and the behaviour we see, it seems that the variables
must be copied from the card to the dll/memory sequentially and in a
manner that is not protected from interruptions by the operating
system. I wonder if there's a way to call the function inside the dll
with high priority? Perhaps writing a wrapper around the dll and
configuring that to be highest priority? 
</p>
<p>
A separate issue is that the counting seems to break down at rates
higher than 400 kHz. This might be an issue with the function
generators I'm using. In any case we are not expecting rates much
higher than this and so have other fish to fry for now.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority issues in LabVIEW:
</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't seem to be able to tackle the priority issues using LVs
tools: LabVIEW allows you to embed the dll call within a subVI, and
then set the priority of that VI as "highest" or "subroutine" (not
entirely clear on the distinction between the two). I've tried both
and neither help with rate issues I have noted. This might have
something to do with the fact that the server handles most of the real
work, and that is not running in high priority mode. Running the
server in HP mode is unfortunately also a no-go, since then we can't
read data in any reasonable amount of time from LV. 
</p>
<p>
I think this just about kills ideas for fixing the priority issues in
this application. So perhaps will we either live with it, or stick to
using the old PMT VI in parallel. The latter further motivates the
idea of a remote interface to Marvin from the trap computer for
running the p7888 functions.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-18 Tue</span></span> Running p7888 vis remotely:
</li>
</ul>

<p>I've written a server and client vi pair for running the PMT program
remotely from another computer. Most of the vi code is packed into the
client program, whilst the server is quite general and simply reads
the command and inputs from the client (via datasocket), executes the
command, and writes the result back to datasocket for the client. It's
all done asynchronously for simplicity, but seems to work quite well
regardless. 
</p>
<p>
In fact the PMT program runs a lot better in remote mode than on
Manati, which can easily be explained by the p7888 server sharing less
resources with labVIEW. This could mean that we can now run all the
data acquisition from the p7888, instead of using the counter
cards.

<p>The datasocket server approach described in the previous entry seems
to run fairly fast and responsive, on the order of &lt;500 ms. In the
spirit of getting things up and running as quickly as possible, I will
probably try to extend the functionality of the server to include all
the dll functions (plus potentially some of my own for data
analysis). Then, an automation program client can be written which
simply tells the client what commands it should executing, and
extracts data as necessary. I don't know whether or not this is going
to be a fast enough approach in terms of time-resolution, but it's
worth a shot.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-03 Thu</span></span> Setup:
</li>
</ul>

<p>A t-piece and bellows coming from the backing line behind the
beam-line turbo pump will be used to pump out a small chamber behind
the pulse-valve. At the same time a small amount on N2 will be leaked
into that chamber via a t-piece and leak-valve.
</p>
<p>
This will hopefully give us control over the amount of N2 we are
introducing into the beam-line, giving us the opportunity to make
pulses that are small enough to be handled by the ion pump in the
second chamber of the beam-line (see <a href="file:///home/nicolas/Documents/logs/dec12/dec12.html">Pressure build-up</a>, Dec. '12).
</p>
<p>
The setup will be built and tested as follows:
</p><ol>
<li>Find/order and install precision, low flow-rate leak valve (6mm)
   for the preliminary chamber.
</li>
<li>Close off beam-line turbo from the backing line, open up backing
   line to the bellows and pre-chamber (protects the turbo from
   back-flow). 
</li>
<li>Pump out bellows and pre-chamber for a few days (heat with
   heat-gun?), open up turbo to the backing line again.
</li>
<li>Introduce N2 via the leak-valve with the pulse valve closed, making
   sure there is a constant flow of N2 through the valve and down the
   backing line. Pressure in this pre-chamber can then be adjusted via
   the leak valve or the close-off valve for the backing line.
</li>
<li>Open pulse-valve with a dc voltage to keep it open, and measure the
   pressure inside the beam-line at the second chamber. Adjust
   pressure inside the second chamber using leak valve. The measured
   pressure change can be used to estimate the flux of N2 in pulsed
   mode. Hopefully by that stage we will know a bit more about how
   much N2 flux is required at the trap for succesful photionisation. 

</li>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-07 Mon</span></span> Preliminary chamber installed:
</li>
</ol>

<p>The `chamber' is installed, and will be pumped down over the next few
days using the turbo backing pump (with the main chamber closed
off). With no gas flow into the main chamber, it should be alright to
leave the TMP on while pumping out the pre-chamber.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Before closing off the backing line from the beam-line:
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
g1 = 1.3E-8 mbar, g2 = 6.6E-8 mbar, Ip = 47 uA
</pre>


<ul>
<li>After closing off (not rising fast any more):
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
g1 = 2.5E-8 mbar, g2 = 7.8E-8 mbar, Ip = 55 uA
</pre>


<ul>
<li>Backing pressure before/after opening pre-chamber:
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
p_b = 6.8E-2 mbar, p_a = 9.0E-2 mbar
</pre>


<ul>
<li>Pressures at the end of the day (5 pm):
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
g1 = 5.1E-8 mbar, g2 = 1.6E-8 mbar, Ip = 32uA, pb = 8.0E-2 mbar
</pre>


<p>
The backing line pressure (pb) is dropping as expected, and the
beam-line looks ok. It's interesting that g2 and Ip have gone down
rather than increased as g1 has.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-08 Tue</span></span> Gauge pressures (9 am):
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
g1 = 1.64E-8, g2 = 3.2E-8, Ip = 14 uA, pb = 7.8E-2
</pre>


<p>
g1 has begun to reduce again, so everything is as expected and there's
probably no need to worry about the TMP running without the backing
line for the moment.
</p>
<p>
I think once the backing line pressure has gone down as low as it was
before the chambers were switched, it's probably ok to open up the
beamline again, so I'm going to go ahead and do that now.

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-09 Wed</span></span> Beamline pressure vs prechamber pressure:

<p>Before the prechamber is opened:
</p><pre class="example">
g1 = 2.7E-9 mbar, g2 = 1.3E-8 mbar, Ip = 4 uA, Pb = 7.8E-2 mbar
</pre>


<p>
N2 regulator pressure:
</p><pre class="example">
P_reg = 1 bar
</pre>


<p>
Pulsed valve opens almost completely at DC 160 mA, fully opened at 230
mA.
</p>
<p>
Prechamber N2 leak valve opened so that backing pressure goes up, this
ensures flow from prechamber to backing pump when the pulse valve is
opened, and prevents oil from from backing pump getting into the
beamline (hopefully). From here, we open the N2 leak valve by steps,
recording the backing line pressure and beamline gauge pressures.

</p>
<p>
Additionally, we require readings of the beamline pressures for the
same backing line pressures, but with the pulsed valve completely
closed. This allows us to account for decrease in TMP efficiency with
higher backing pressures.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Error! 
</li>
</ul>

<p>The readings above were taken with the valve that separates
the two beamline chambers <i>open</i>. Apparently Matthias had been
playing around with them in between the time I last used it and left
it closed. I have now closed the valve and will retake both data sets
in the morning.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-10 Thu</span></span> Re-take earlier measurements?:
</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking back on my data of 4th Dec. `12, I'm not entirely convinced
that this was done with the separator valve closed, which is something
of a disaster, since that means we've already bought the parts for
improving the system when it hasn't actually been properly tested. The
measurement that day consisted of pulsing N2 into the system (without
a prechamber), with a very low repetition rate so that the system has
time to pump out before each pulse. The readings on the two gauges
seem very close together, indicating that the separator valve was open
instead of closed. 
</p>
<p>
It would be worthwhile having a quick look at these
measurements again (by closing the prechamber off from the backing
line and opening its leak valve fully). It's probably also worthwhile
finding a way to sample the max pressure in the second chamber, rather
than the pressure after some time after the pulse.
</p>
<ul>

<p>
How can I use this data to calculate the approximate pressure of N2 in
a single 10 us pulse? Well at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, we expect:
</p><pre class="example">
P_p = P*R, R = T_p/T_rep, T_rep = 1/10, T_p = 10 us, P = 1E-8 -&gt; 1E-7 mbar
gives: P_p = 1E-12 -&gt; 1E-11
</pre>


<p>
This tells us that, with prechamber pressure P<sub>b</sub> = 0.6, we expect no
additional pressure in the second chamber when the system is pulsed. A
test of this wouldn't take long, and I'll conduct one soon. 
</p>
<p>
Increasing the prechamber pressure much higher than these values risks
ruining the general vacuum in the system (column 2 and to a lesser
extent 3 in the previous table).
</p>
<p>
Will this be enough N2 for the experiment however? We can probably
make an estimate of the peak density of N2 using these numbers and the
volume of the chamber. In any case the new equipment (a TMP for the
second chamber) should improve the performance and allow us to run
without the prechamber for higher N2 density.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-14 Mon</span></span> Pulsed testing:
</li>
</ul>

<p>As expected, testing the system in pulsed mode showed that even at
maximum pulse voltage (210 V) there was no increase in pressure in the
second chamber.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-25 Fri</span></span> Revisiting:
</li>
</ul>

<p>I am revisiting the tests on the preliminary chamber. The new idea is
to test whether or not we can get the full range of pressures, from
those documented above, up to the range we had with no
prechamber. 
</p>
<p>
In the above experiments, pressure in the prechamber was
limited by the load on the backing-line, but I didn't think about
closing off the backing-line in order to increase the pressure in the
prechamber. 
</p>
<p>
Plots of the previous data show that I can open the prechamber
leak-valve up until the backing chamber shows 0.5 mbar before the
pressure in the beamline chamber (second chamber) starts to increase
significantly with the pulse valve closed. At this point, with the
pulse valve statically open, we had a pressure of ~0.7E-7 mbar. It's
at this point that I will start to close down the prechamber's valve
to the backing-line. N.B. these measurements were taken with 230 mA
used to open the pulse valve.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Aside:
</li>
</ul>

<p>One point to make is that if the load is too high with the pulsed
valve statically open, then we can test in pulsed mode and try and
match up the data to that from <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-13</span></span> (pulsed mode, no
prechamber). 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Result:
</li>
</ul>

<p>Not much to see here. The backing-line valve closes too sharply to
make use of it as a variable limiter for the pressure in the
prechamber. During the sharp transition nothing settles appreciably in
a reasonable amount of time, but when it does it looks more or less
the same as the results from <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-13</span></span>. (Tested in pulsed mode
because pressure would probably be very soon too high for static
mode).
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-28 Mon</span></span> Another test:
</li>
</ul>

<p>I can redo this test with another precision leak valve placed in
between the prechamber and the backing-line valve. This should give me
more control over the pressure in the prechamber.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Results:
</li>
</ul>

<p>Second leak-valve fully open, relying on it being a smaller aperture
for the backing to pump through, therefore a higher pressure in the
prechamber.

<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-29 Tue</span></span> Finished?
</li>
</ul>

<p>It's clear that the leak valve used in the above measurements is too
small, and the valve used in previous experiments is too large. The
ideal would be somewhere in between, but I haven't found an
appropriate valve yet.

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-14 Mon</span></span> The problem:
</li>
</ul>

<p>I went to test the system in the configuration without the prechamber
(by simply closing off the prechamber from the backing pump), but as I
opened the prechamber N2 leak valve I found that the pressure in all
chambers rose very quickly (though the backing pump maintained a
reasonable pressure). 
</p>
<p>
The pulse valve was not pulsing, and had only the normal 30 V dc
offset that comes from the pulse electronics from Oxford (this is
presumably configured to be low enough current that it does not hold
the valve open).
</p>
<p>
Overall this is quite worrying, and requires some investigation, which
I will continue when the chambers have pumped down to base pressure
once again.
</p>
<p>
 <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-15 Tue</span></span> Not reproduced:
I've let the system pump down to some reasonable pressure overnight,
and gone back to try and reproduce the problem in a controlled way. It
seems that I can't reproduce it today, and the pressure in the main
chambers stays fine no matter how open the N2 valve is.
</p>
<p>
Before I started this new test however, I did have a quick
hand-tighten of the valve that blocks the prechamber from the backing
line. I guess it's possible that this was the source of the problem,
and that hand-tighten did the trick of fixing it. I should be wary of
this issue when next dealing with that valve.

</li>
</ul>

<p>I've re-done some of the measurements of the pulse valve
characteristics without the prechamber (blocked off from backing
line). At 10 Hz the results match closely with those of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-11-13</span></span>,
so I won't write out those results and replot them, but they're in my
notes of today. The final optimum g1/g2 ratio is ~50 at max valve
opening and g2 = 1E-6 mbar.
</p>
<ul>
<li>0.1 Hz testing:
</li>
</ul>

<p>The separator valve is confirmed to be closed, so now what I want is
to re-do the measurements with repetion rate 0.1 Hz, because those
came out quite strange, and I was suspicious that the separator was
open at the time. 
</p>
<p>
My notes of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-04 Tue</span></span> summarise the data taken then:
"The data is in my notebook entry for yesterday, but the brief summary
is that with a rep. rate of 0.1 Hz (i.e. 10 s pumping time), pressures
starts to build up in the chamber at a pulse height of around 180
V. At this point the pressure peak in the beam chamber is around
(7+/-2)E-9 mbar. Compared to the non-pulsed pressure of 4.3E-9 mbar,
this indicates very low pumping power/speed in the second chamber." 
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure those notes make sense to me, but the data shows that the
maximum pulsed pressure is 5E-8 in the second chamber compared to
4.2E-9 in the first. A higher pressure in the second chamber indicates
a problem, which is why I'm going to try and retake the data.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-16 Wed</span></span> Data taken:
</li>
</ul>

<p>Again the data is not particularly striking, but can be found in my
lab book notes of today. The data is sufficiently different to that
taken <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-12-04</span></span> to assume that I had the separator valve open on
that occasion. 
</p>
<p>
The most important notes on these measurements are that chamber two
takes longer than a second to pump down to base - usually 1 s is
enough to clear a large chunk of the pressure, but the last 10% takes
another 1 second. This lends strong evidence to the `build up' effect
theory, and that we need more pumping power in the second chamber, or
less N2 behind the pulse valve (prechamber method).
</p>
<p>
I don't think much else can be drawn from the data, since it seems to
me that the gauge displays (or gauges themselves) are not fast enough
to give data on peak pressures i.e. the values seen and noted are
long-term averages, relative to the pulse length.

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-03 Thu</span></span> Outline:
</li>
</ul>

<p>We might be able to get away without using the beam-line for some
experiments. For instance we intend to do N2 rotational state
spectroscopy using LICT with Ar (see <a href="file:///home/nicolas/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular physics/PRA83.PDF">PRA 83, 023415 (2012)</a> and <a href="file:///home/nicolas/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular physics/PRL105.PDF">PRL 105, 143001 (2010)</a>). To do this without the beam-line, we can leak in
a mixture of N2 and Ar via a mixing pre-chamber to the trap. Ideally
we can selectively photionise N2 without ionising Ar, and
sympathetically cool it into an ion crystal. Then we use a
spectroscopy laser to excite it to a state where it will undergo
charge-exchange with Ar with high probability. Our spectroscopy signal
is then the rate of mass change of the ion crystal (due to to N2+
swapping out with Ar+) as a function of the spectroscopy laser
frequency. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some issues:
</li>
</ul>

<p>The main consideration regarding whether or not this can be done
without the beam-line i.e. with just leak valves, is whether or not we
can efficiently photionise N2 whilst keeping the partial pressure of
N2 low w.r.t. a given partial pressure of Ar. This is necessary
because charge exchange between N2+ and N2 has almost the same
cross-section as N2+ and Ar, and that process will redistribute our
rotational populations disadvantageously (mean rotational level high
enough to leave low levels sparsely populated - need some calculations
for this). But this is for the N2 PI setup to determine.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup:
</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway I must prepare the mixing and leaking apparatus for the trap,
and test what pressures we can increase the trap-chamber pressure to
from the leak valve, whilst keeping the TMP load reasonable and still
being able to trap a single ion. Perhaps I should be sure that Amy has
finished her characterisation before doing this, in case there is a
chance that the TMP fails (low probability).
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-07 Mon</span></span> Handed over to Amy.

<p>I've informed Amy of the tests on her trap, and she's going to run
through it with Matthias as well. Presumably then, she can handle
this.

<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-31 Thu</span></span> First calculations:
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first calculations I made indicate that using amplitude modulation
at the trap frequency, instead of lasers detuned by the trap
frequency, has the same amplitude of component at the trap frequency
as the latter method. This doesn't seem intuitive to me, since in the
walking wave setup, the dipole force should swing from positive to
negative, whereas in the AM method (standing wave), the force should
only swing from positive to zero. I need to go over these calculations
again to be sure there are no mistakes, and rethink if there aren't.
</p>
<p>
Regardless the low cost of the AM method (we have all the parts we
need already), makes it a tempting start. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-31 Thu</span></span> Left the calculations with Matthias for now.
</li>
</ul>

<p>He's gone through them and is happy that AM might be good enough to
work, especially considering the ease of setup. His main concern is
that there is an intensity component that does not contribute to the
dipole force, but does contribute to spontaneous decay events,
therefore the process is less coherent.

</li>
</ul>

<p>If all we require is AM beam, then we can use a single-pass AOM to do
the job. 
</p>
<p>
Since we're not concerned about whether we modulate one beam,
or both, we can modulate the beam before splitting it, and then
recombine at the ion to give us our modulated standing wave.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to achieve this is by retro-reflecting the incoming
beam with a mirror mounted on a PZT (for phase compensation), and
overlapping the reflection using the optical fibre. An interferometer
can be placed as close as possible to the trap in order to
monitor/lock the phase in conjunction with the PZT.

an active TODO, but leave it in the list.

<p>I've managed to install windows 7 using a spare license key. I can
probably install most of the software I need manually, and get by
without the software I can't. This is a better long-term arrangement
for me than the above.

<p>I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page
of the site (extended abstract?).
</p>
<p>  
Furthermore, I think it'd be nice to look over the diagrams that are
on there already, and think about whether or not I could make some
improved ones in POVRAY.

<p>Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:
</p>
<p>
"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.
</p>
<p>
By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."
</p>
<p>
Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(<a href="http://www.microchip.com/">http://www.microchip.com/</a>). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2013-01-04 Fri</span></span> Comments on current webpage:
</li>
<li>There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
</li>
<li>Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
</li>
<li>Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?
</li>

<p>Look closer at the reactions that are proposed to investigate in the
proposal, and make sure that there are going to be setups for those
experiments, or ones to do with our research here, at Oxford.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactions -&gt; Deuterium fractionation:
</li>
</ul>

<p>Reactions involving H atom transfer to ionic species e.g.:
</p><pre class="example">
Ca^+ + HD0 -&gt; CaH^+(CaD^+) + OD(H)
Nd_3^+ + HDO -&gt; ND_4^+(ND_3H^+) + OH(OD)
</pre>


<p>
Addition reactions with H atom elimination (e.g. in <a href="file:///home/nicolas/Documents/literature/proposals/ProjectDescription.pdf">proposal</a>), and
Near-thermoneutral charge transfer reactions (e.g. at link).
</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimental:
</li>
</ul>

<p>In-situ measurement of masses and numbers of reactants and
products -&gt; Monitor sequential isotopic exchange.
</p>
<p>
Quantum-state selected reactants from stark decelerator (neutrals) and
REMPI (ions). Thermal redistribution of ions monitored by
non-destructive state-detection.
