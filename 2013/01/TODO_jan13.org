* To do, Molecular Lab Experiments

** TODO Code an automation program for experiments
*** General progress:
- <2012-10-05 Fri> 
[[file:~/Documents/molecule_trap/automation/automation_project.org][project org file]]
- <2012-12-18 Tue>
PMT program written. Locally run vers. suffers from priority/resource
sharing issues, but remotely run version with client/server works
fine.

Client is general and light, just runs the command that it reads from
the datasocket (LV communication protocol).
- <2013-01-28 Mon> Program stuck:
Datasocket error that I can't identify. Reminder to get back on it,
even though I have no idea how to fix this problem.

*** TODO Contact FAST ComTec
About the issue with having to communicate with the card via the
server. 

** Write simulation of 8-level atom for experiments
*** DONE Dark resonance spectroscopy/amplification
- <2012-10-05 Fri>
  Matthias has a reference (paper or lecture course) that
  shows a way in which we can account for laser linewidth in
  simulations. Chase up.
- <2012-10-23 Tue> Easiest thing right now is incorporate Wolfgang's
  matlab simulation into mine
- <2013-01-22 Tue> Written and debugging.
- <2013-01-25 Fri> Virtually complete, just needs dephasing term from
  laser linewidth.
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Laser linewidth included. Now can be used for
  investigating the dark resonance (and Hanle effect?).

*** CNCL Hanle effect B-field sensor
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Adapt simulation for Hanle effect:
This might help Kevin in understanding the fast drop off of his
B-field signal (at only moderate frequency).
- Don't think it's going to work:
The method we use in the other simulations works out the steady-state
of the density matrix, so we can't use that specific solution for
working out the dynamic response of the system.
*** Single ion-heat engine

** TODO Work on DACs for the new SCL
*** TODO Building boards
- <2013-01-25 Fri> Matthias has the plans:
Pester him for them.
- <2013-01-31 Thu> Received:
Matthias sent them ages ago, but I didn't spot them in my mail. He's
still yet to order the actual DACs though, so there's still time. I
could make the boards however, in preparation.
*** Programming
** Beam-line preparation
*** Second TMP installation
- <2012-12-04 Tue>
Data in previous headline indicates there's not enough pumping power
and the ion trap region in the beamline chamber. It's time to consider
adding a turbo to pump alongside the ion pump to maintain a good
pressure differential between the beamline and the trapping region. 
- <2013-01-03 Thu>
Matthias has ordered the parts, but we are trying a setup that may not
require them first (see entry on preliminary N2 chamber)

*** DONE Characterise preliminary N2 chamber
- <2013-01-03 Thu> Setup:
A t-piece and bellows coming from the backing line behind the
beam-line turbo pump will be used to pump out a small chamber behind
the pulse-valve. At the same time a small amount on N2 will be leaked
into that chamber via a t-piece and leak-valve.

This will hopefully give us control over the amount of N2 we are
introducing into the beam-line, giving us the opportunity to make
pulses that are small enough to be handled by the ion pump in the
second chamber of the beam-line (see [[file:~/Documents/logs/dec12/dec12.org::*Pressure%20build-up][Pressure build-up]], Dec. '12).

The setup will be built and tested as follows:
1. Find/order and install precision, low flow-rate leak valve (6mm)
   for the preliminary chamber.
2. Close off beam-line turbo from the backing line, open up backing
   line to the bellows and pre-chamber (protects the turbo from
   back-flow). 
3. Pump out bellows and pre-chamber for a few days (heat with
   heat-gun?), open up turbo to the backing line again.
4. Introduce N2 via the leak-valve with the pulse valve closed, making
   sure there is a constant flow of N2 through the valve and down the
   backing line. Pressure in this pre-chamber can then be adjusted via
   the leak valve or the close-off valve for the backing line.
5. Open pulse-valve with a dc voltage to keep it open, and measure the
   pressure inside the beam-line at the second chamber. Adjust
   pressure inside the second chamber using leak valve. The measured
   pressure change can be used to estimate the flux of N2 in pulsed
   mode. Hopefully by that stage we will know a bit more about how
   much N2 flux is required at the trap for succesful photionisation. 

- <2013-01-07 Mon> Preliminary chamber installed:
The `chamber' is installed, and will be pumped down over the next few
days using the turbo backing pump (with the main chamber closed
off). With no gas flow into the main chamber, it should be alright to
leave the TMP on while pumping out the pre-chamber.

- Before closing off the backing line from the beam-line:
: g1 = 1.3E-8 mbar, g2 = 6.6E-8 mbar, Ip = 47 uA

- After closing off (not rising fast any more):
: g1 = 2.5E-8 mbar, g2 = 7.8E-8 mbar, Ip = 55 uA

- Backing pressure before/after opening pre-chamber:
: p_b = 6.8E-2 mbar, p_a = 9.0E-2 mbar

- Pressures at the end of the day (5 pm):
: g1 = 5.1E-8 mbar, g2 = 1.6E-8 mbar, Ip = 32uA, pb = 8.0E-2 mbar

The backing line pressure (pb) is dropping as expected, and the
beam-line looks ok. It's interesting that g2 and Ip have gone down
rather than increased as g1 has.

- <2013-01-08 Tue> Gauge pressures (9 am):
: g1 = 1.64E-8, g2 = 3.2E-8, Ip = 14 uA, pb = 7.8E-2

g1 has begun to reduce again, so everything is as expected and there's
probably no need to worry about the TMP running without the backing
line for the moment.

I think once the backing line pressure has gone down as low as it was
before the chambers were switched, it's probably ok to open up the
beamline again, so I'm going to go ahead and do that now.

- <2013-01-09 Wed> Beamline pressure vs prechamber pressure:
Before the prechamber is opened:
: g1 = 2.7E-9 mbar, g2 = 1.3E-8 mbar, Ip = 4 uA, Pb = 7.8E-2 mbar

N2 regulator pressure:
: P_reg = 1 bar

Pulsed valve opens almost completely at DC 160 mA, fully opened at 230
mA.

Prechamber N2 leak valve opened so that backing pressure goes up, this
ensures flow from prechamber to backing pump when the pulse valve is
opened, and prevents oil from from backing pump getting into the
beamline (hopefully). From here, we open the N2 leak valve by steps,
recording the backing line pressure and beamline gauge pressures.

[[file:beam_line_9_1_13.csv::Pb%20/mbar,%20g1%20/mbar,%20g2%20/mbar,%20Ip%20/uA][Data (csv)]]
- Gauge and ion pump readings vs prechamber pressure (N.B. BAD DATA,
  separator valve /open/):
[[file:beam_line_data_09_01_13.png]]

Additionally, we require readings of the beamline pressures for the
same backing line pressures, but with the pulsed valve completely
closed. This allows us to account for decrease in TMP efficiency with
higher backing pressures.

- Error! 
The readings above were taken with the valve that separates
the two beamline chambers /open/. Apparently Matthias had been
playing around with them in between the time I last used it and left
it closed. I have now closed the valve and will retake both data sets
in the morning.

- <2013-01-10 Thu> Re-take earlier measurements?:
Looking back on my data of 4th Dec. `12, I'm not entirely convinced
that this was done with the separator valve closed, which is something
of a disaster, since that means we've already bought the parts for
improving the system when it hasn't actually been properly tested. The
measurement that day consisted of pulsing N2 into the system (without
a prechamber), with a very low repetition rate so that the system has
time to pump out before each pulse. The readings on the two gauges
seem very close together, indicating that the separator valve was open
instead of closed. 

It would be worthwhile having a quick look at these
measurements again (by closing the prechamber off from the backing
line and opening its leak valve fully). It's probably also worthwhile
finding a way to sample the max pressure in the second chamber, rather
than the pressure after some time after the pulse.

- Today's data (separator valve closed):
Regardless, I retook yesterday's data with the separator valve in the
opposite position, which I assume now is closed (and which the results
indicate).

How can I use this data to calculate the approximate pressure of N2 in
a single 10 us pulse? Well at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, we expect:
: P_p = P*R, R = T_p/T_rep, T_rep = 1/10, T_p = 10 us, P = 1E-8 -> 1E-7 mbar
: gives: P_p = 1E-12 -> 1E-11

This tells us that, with prechamber pressure P_b = 0.6, we expect no
additional pressure in the second chamber when the system is pulsed. A
test of this wouldn't take long, and I'll conduct one soon. 

Increasing the prechamber pressure much higher than these values risks
ruining the general vacuum in the system (column 2 and to a lesser
extent 3 in the previous table).

Will this be enough N2 for the experiment however? We can probably
make an estimate of the peak density of N2 using these numbers and the
volume of the chamber. In any case the new equipment (a TMP for the
second chamber) should improve the performance and allow us to run
without the prechamber for higher N2 density.

- <2013-01-14 Mon> Pulsed testing:
As expected, testing the system in pulsed mode showed that even at
maximum pulse voltage (210 V) there was no increase in pressure in the
second chamber.

- <2013-01-25 Fri> Revisiting:
I am revisiting the tests on the preliminary chamber. The new idea is
to test whether or not we can get the full range of pressures, from
those documented above, up to the range we had with no
prechamber. 

In the above experiments, pressure in the prechamber was
limited by the load on the backing-line, but I didn't think about
closing off the backing-line in order to increase the pressure in the
prechamber. 

Plots of the previous data show that I can open the prechamber
leak-valve up until the backing chamber shows 0.5 mbar before the
pressure in the beamline chamber (second chamber) starts to increase
significantly with the pulse valve closed. At this point, with the
pulse valve statically open, we had a pressure of ~0.7E-7 mbar. It's
at this point that I will start to close down the prechamber's valve
to the backing-line. N.B. these measurements were taken with 230 mA
used to open the pulse valve.

- Aside:
One point to make is that if the load is too high with the pulsed
valve statically open, then we can test in pulsed mode and try and
match up the data to that from <2012-11-13> (pulsed mode, no
prechamber). 

- Result:
Not much to see here. The backing-line valve closes too sharply to
make use of it as a variable limiter for the pressure in the
prechamber. During the sharp transition nothing settles appreciably in
a reasonable amount of time, but when it does it looks more or less
the same as the results from <2012-11-13>. (Tested in pulsed mode
because pressure would probably be very soon too high for static
mode).

- <2013-01-28 Mon> Another test:
I can redo this test with another precision leak valve placed in
between the prechamber and the backing-line valve. This should give me
more control over the pressure in the prechamber.

- Results:
Second leak-valve fully open, relying on it being a smaller aperture
for the backing to pump through, therefore a higher pressure in the
prechamber.

- <2013-01-29 Tue> Finished?
It's clear that the leak valve used in the above measurements is too
small, and the valve used in previous experiments is too large. The
ideal would be somewhere in between, but I haven't found an
appropriate valve yet. 

*** DONE Possible leak in the pulse valve? - Not reproduced.
- <2013-01-14 Mon> The problem:
I went to test the system in the configuration without the prechamber
(by simply closing off the prechamber from the backing pump), but as I
opened the prechamber N2 leak valve I found that the pressure in all
chambers rose very quickly (though the backing pump maintained a
reasonable pressure). 

The pulse valve was not pulsing, and had only the normal 30 V dc
offset that comes from the pulse electronics from Oxford (this is
presumably configured to be low enough current that it does not hold
the valve open).

Overall this is quite worrying, and requires some investigation, which
I will continue when the chambers have pumped down to base pressure
once again.

<2013-01-15 Tue> Not reproduced:
I've let the system pump down to some reasonable pressure overnight,
and gone back to try and reproduce the problem in a controlled way. It
seems that I can't reproduce it today, and the pressure in the main
chambers stays fine no matter how open the N2 valve is.

Before I started this new test however, I did have a quick
hand-tighten of the valve that blocks the prechamber from the backing
line. I guess it's possible that this was the source of the problem,
and that hand-tighten did the trick of fixing it. I should be wary of
this issue when next dealing with that valve.

*** DONE Re-do pulse valve testing sans-prechamber
- <2013-01-16 Wed> Preliminary test:
I've re-done some of the measurements of the pulse valve
characteristics without the prechamber (blocked off from backing
line). At 10 Hz the results match closely with those of <2012-11-13>,
so I won't write out those results and replot them, but they're in my
notes of today. The final optimum g1/g2 ratio is ~50 at max valve
opening and g2 = 1E-6 mbar.

- 0.1 Hz testing:
The separator valve is confirmed to be closed, so now what I want is
to re-do the measurements with repetion rate 0.1 Hz, because those
came out quite strange, and I was suspicious that the separator was
open at the time. 

My notes of <2012-12-04 Tue> summarise the data taken then:
"The data is in my notebook entry for yesterday, but the brief summary
is that with a rep. rate of 0.1 Hz (i.e. 10 s pumping time), pressures
starts to build up in the chamber at a pulse height of around 180
V. At this point the pressure peak in the beam chamber is around
(7+/-2)E-9 mbar. Compared to the non-pulsed pressure of 4.3E-9 mbar,
this indicates very low pumping power/speed in the second chamber." 

I'm not sure those notes make sense to me, but the data shows that the
maximum pulsed pressure is 5E-8 in the second chamber compared to
4.2E-9 in the first. A higher pressure in the second chamber indicates
a problem, which is why I'm going to try and retake the data.

- <2013-01-16 Wed> Data taken:
Again the data is not particularly striking, but can be found in my
lab book notes of today. The data is sufficiently different to that
taken <2012-12-04> to assume that I had the separator valve open on
that occasion. 

The most important notes on these measurements are that chamber two
takes longer than a second to pump down to base - usually 1 s is
enough to clear a large chunk of the pressure, but the last 10% takes
another 1 second. This lends strong evidence to the `build up' effect
theory, and that we need more pumping power in the second chamber, or
less N2 behind the pulse valve (prechamber method).

I don't think much else can be drawn from the data, since it seems to
me that the gauge displays (or gauges themselves) are not fast enough
to give data on peak pressures i.e. the values seen and noted are
long-term averages, relative to the pulse length.

** Non-beam-line Ar experiment
*** CNCL Preparation
- <2013-01-03 Thu> Outline:
We might be able to get away without using the beam-line for some
experiments. For instance we intend to do N2 rotational state
spectroscopy using LICT with Ar (see [[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/PRA83.PDF][PRA 83, 023415 (2012)]] and [[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/PRL105.PDF][PRL
105, 143001 (2010)]]). To do this without the beam-line, we can leak in
a mixture of N2 and Ar via a mixing pre-chamber to the trap. Ideally
we can selectively photionise N2 without ionising Ar, and
sympathetically cool it into an ion crystal. Then we use a
spectroscopy laser to excite it to a state where it will undergo
charge-exchange with Ar with high probability. Our spectroscopy signal
is then the rate of mass change of the ion crystal (due to to N2+
swapping out with Ar+) as a function of the spectroscopy laser
frequency. 

- Some issues:
The main consideration regarding whether or not this can be done
without the beam-line i.e. with just leak valves, is whether or not we
can efficiently photionise N2 whilst keeping the partial pressure of
N2 low w.r.t. a given partial pressure of Ar. This is necessary
because charge exchange between N2+ and N2 has almost the same
cross-section as N2+ and Ar, and that process will redistribute our
rotational populations disadvantageously (mean rotational level high
enough to leave low levels sparsely populated - need some calculations
for this). But this is for the N2 PI setup to determine.

- Setup:
Anyway I must prepare the mixing and leaking apparatus for the trap,
and test what pressures we can increase the trap-chamber pressure to
from the leak valve, whilst keeping the TMP load reasonable and still
being able to trap a single ion. Perhaps I should be sure that Amy has
finished her characterisation before doing this, in case there is a
chance that the TMP fails (low probability).

- <2013-01-07 Mon> Handed over to Amy.
I've informed Amy of the tests on her trap, and she's going to run
through it with Matthias as well. Presumably then, she can handle
this.

** TODO Dipole force laser setup
*** DONE Calculations
- <2013-01-31 Thu> First calculations:
The first calculations I made indicate that using amplitude modulation
at the trap frequency, instead of lasers detuned by the trap
frequency, has the same amplitude of component at the trap frequency
as the latter method. This doesn't seem intuitive to me, since in the
walking wave setup, the dipole force should swing from positive to
negative, whereas in the AM method (standing wave), the force should
only swing from positive to zero. I need to go over these calculations
again to be sure there are no mistakes, and rethink if there aren't.

Regardless the low cost of the AM method (we have all the parts we
need already), makes it a tempting start. 

- <2013-01-31 Thu> Left the calculations with Matthias for now.
He's gone through them and is happy that AM might be good enough to
work, especially considering the ease of setup. His main concern is
that there is an intensity component that does not contribute to the
dipole force, but does contribute to spontaneous decay events,
therefore the process is less coherent.

*** TODO Equipment
- <2013-02-01 Fri> AM setup:
If all we require is AM beam, then we can use a single-pass AOM to do
the job. 

Since we're not concerned about whether we modulate one beam,
or both, we can modulate the beam before splitting it, and then
recombine at the ion to give us our modulated standing wave.

The simplest way to achieve this is by retro-reflecting the incoming
beam with a mirror mounted on a PZT (for phase compensation), and
overlapping the reflection using the optical fibre. An interferometer
can be placed as close as possible to the trap in order to
monitor/lock the phase in conjunction with the PZT.

I've managed to install windows 7 using a spare license key. I can
probably install most of the software I need manually, and get by
without the software I can't. This is a better long-term arrangement
for me than the above.

Matthias has reminded us to look through the old website for these.

I should add a scanning cavity lock section to the "Technology" page
of the site (extended abstract?).
  
Furthermore, I think it'd be nice to look over the diagrams that are
on there already, and think about whether or not I could make some
improved ones in POVRAY.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 075109 2010:

"We have implemented a compact setup for long-term laser frequency
stabilization. Light from a stable reference laser and several slave
lasers is coupled into a confocal Fabry–Pérot resonator. By
stabilizing the position of the transmission peaks of the slave lasers
relative to successive peaks of the master laser as the length of the
cavity is scanned over one free spectral range, the long-term
stability of the master laser is transferred to the slave lasers.

By using fast analog peak detection and low-latency
microcontroller-based digital feedback, with a scanning frequency of 3
kHz, we obtain a feedback bandwidth of 380 Hz and a relative stability
of better than 10 kHz at timescales longer than 1 s."

Current undergraduate/masters projects are focused on implementing our
scanning cavity lock design with a cheap and feature-rich
microcontroller from the dsPIC line
(http://www.microchip.com/). Automated impulse-response-function
analysis and digital filter generation will provide significant
improvements to bandwidth and stability.

- <2013-01-04 Fri> Comments on current webpage:
1. There are no sub-titles at the lowest level of the pages when looking
   at the research interests. e.g. "ion-photon entanglement" is a page
   inside "cavity-QED", but when you click on it it is title only
   "cavity-QED".
2. Only "charge exchange reactions" in the molecular physics
   section. Should we show something about our research direction?
3. Can we add references to our papers in the "crystal weighing" and
   "optical excitation" sections?

** Ask Hiroki for a look at the code for cavity mode prop.

Asked Hiroki, but he hasn't finished it yet. 

** Oxford group proposal research
- <2012-12-05 Wed>
  * Drewsen group BBR assisted cooling
  * Previous ammonia research
  * Ammonia level structure for state-detection
- <2012-12-10 Mon>
  * Drewsen and Schiller both have papers on BBR according to the proposal.
  * Drewsen proposal uses Raman transitions, requiring narrow/stable
    lasers - does this apply to our system?
- <2012-12-17 Mon>
E-mail Brianna to assess the status of the Stark decelerator.
- <2013-01-03 Thu> General:
Look closer at the reactions that are proposed to investigate in the
proposal, and make sure that there are going to be setups for those
experiments, or ones to do with our research here, at Oxford.

- Reactions -> Deuterium fractionation:
Reactions involving H atom transfer to ionic species e.g.:
: Ca^+ + HD0 -> CaH^+(CaD^+) + OD(H)
: Nd_3^+ + HDO -> ND_4^+(ND_3H^+) + OH(OD)

Addition reactions with H atom elimination (e.g. in [[file:~/Documents/literature/proposals/ProjectDescription.pdf][proposal]]), and
Near-thermoneutral charge transfer reactions (e.g. at link).

- Experimental:
In-situ measurement of masses and numbers of reactants and
products -> Monitor sequential isotopic exchange.

Quantum-state selected reactants from stark decelerator (neutrals) and
REMPI (ions). Thermal redistribution of ions monitored by
non-destructive state-detection.

Control internal states using BBR assisted schemes (see [[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/nphys1604.pdf][nphys1604]] and
[[file:~/Documents/literature/papers/Molecular%20physics/nphys1605.pdf][nphys1605]]).

*** Macros
Here is how to define a keyboard macro:
`C-x (’ – start defining a keyboard macro
`C-x )’ – stop defining the keyboard macro

And here is how to execute a keyboard macro you’ve defined:
‘C-x e’ – execute the keyboard macro

Here’s how to execute the macro 37 times (you use ‘C-u’ to provide the 37):
‘C-u 37 C-x e’
